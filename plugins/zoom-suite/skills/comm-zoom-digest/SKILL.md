# COMM-ZOOM-DIGEST — Weekly Meeting Digest

> **Requires:** Zoom MCP connector. Designed to be scheduled weekly — recommend Monday 7:00 AM.
> **Best paired with:** bizops-daily-brief (surfaces open items), comm-zoom-debrief (deeper dive on any meeting).

## Overview

Start every week knowing exactly what happened and what's still unfinished. This skill pulls all cloud recordings from the past week, generates a summary of each, cross-references Cloud Brain to identify action items that should have been completed, flags recurring themes that suggest bigger issues or opportunities, and delivers a clean weekly digest — including a prioritized list of open loops you're carrying into the new week.

Scheduled weekly, this becomes an automatic accountability layer: you never lose a commitment, a follow-up, or a strategic thread buried in a recording.

---

## When This Skill Applies

- User says "weekly meeting digest" or "zoom digest"
- User says "what happened in my meetings last week?"
- User says "summarize all my meetings from this week"
- User says "what are my open action items from recent meetings?"
- User says "review my Zoom recordings for the week"
- **Scheduled run:** every Monday morning automatically

---

## Pre-Flight — User Preferences

Search Cloud Brain: `mcp__cloud-brain__search_notes` with query `"zoom digest preferences"`.

**If preferences ARE found:** Confirm in one line — *"Running your weekly digest for [user name] — [date range]."*

**If NOT found:** Collect once before proceeding:

1. Your name (for identifying your action items vs. others')
2. Preferred digest time window (default: past 7 days — Mon–Sun)
3. Preferred digest depth: **Brief** (one paragraph per meeting) or **Detailed** (full decisions + action items per meeting)?
4. Should the digest be saved as a Zoom Doc? Yes / No
5. Which categories of meetings should be excluded from the digest, if any? (e.g., internal team standups, personal 1:1s)

Save to `brain/preferences/zoom-digest-preferences.md`.

---

## Step 1: Determine the Digest Period

Default: past 7 days (last Monday through last Sunday).

If the user specifies a different period ("this month", "last two weeks", specific dates), use that range instead.

Set `from` and `to` dates accordingly in UTC format.

---

## Step 2: Pull All Recordings

Call `mcp__zoom__recordings_list` with:
- `from`: start of the digest period (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `to`: end of the digest period (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `page_size`: 50 (capture all meetings in the period)

This returns all cloud recordings the user hosted during the period.

**If no recordings found:** Report — *"No cloud recordings found for [date range]. Either no meetings were recorded, or recordings are stored locally rather than in the cloud. You may need to enable cloud recording in Zoom settings."*

**Filter out excluded categories** (if the user set exclusion preferences): skip meetings whose topics match excluded patterns.

---

## Step 3: Summarize Each Meeting

For each recording, call `mcp__zoom__get_meeting_assets` to get the AI summary, participants, and any Zoom-generated next steps.

If the brief summary from the AI is insufficient for the user's preferred depth setting, also call `mcp__zoom__get_recording_resource` with `types: "summary,nextStep"` to get topic-level summaries and Zoom's next steps list.

For each meeting, extract:
- **Meeting title and date**
- **Attendees** (external contacts flagged separately from internal)
- **What it was about** (1–3 sentences depending on depth preference)
- **Key decisions made** (if any)
- **Action items generated** (owner + task + deadline)
- **Follow-ups outstanding** (what needs to happen next)

---

## Step 4: Cross-Reference Brain for Unresolved Items

This is the accountability layer. Check whether action items from previous weeks' digests were actually completed.

Search Cloud Brain: `mcp__cloud-brain__search_notes` with query `"zoom digest"` to find prior weekly digest notes.

For each prior digest found (look back 2–4 weeks):
- Read the action items that were listed as open
- Check if any of those same items appear to have been resolved (look for completion signals in this week's meeting summaries or in other brain notes)
- Items that were open last week and haven't appeared as resolved = **Carried Over Open Items**

Flag these prominently in the digest — they are the highest priority output.

---

## Step 5: Identify Cross-Meeting Themes

Scan across all meeting summaries from the week and identify:

**Recurring topics:** Any subject that came up in 2+ meetings. These often signal a priority that deserves focused attention.

**Recurring people:** Any external person who appeared in multiple meetings this week. This might indicate an important relationship that's heating up.

**Unresolved patterns:** Action items from this week that duplicate action items from prior weeks — suggesting chronic follow-through issues on a topic.

**Escalation signals:** Any topic where the language escalated week over week (e.g., "looking into it" → "still pending" → "urgent").

---

## Step 6: Build the Digest

Assemble the complete weekly digest:

```markdown
# Weekly Meeting Digest — Week of [Mon Date] to [Sun Date]
*Generated [Today's Date] | [N] meetings | [N] total recordings*

---

## ⚠️ Open Items Carried Over (Resolve These First)
[Items from prior weeks that are still unresolved]

| Item | Source Meeting | Originally Assigned | Weeks Open |
|------|---------------|---------------------|------------|
| [Action item] | [Meeting name, date] | [Owner] | [N] weeks |

---

## Your Action Items This Week
[All action items assigned to the user across all this week's meetings]

| # | Action | From Meeting | Deadline |
|---|--------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | [Task] | [Meeting name] | [Date/TBD] |
| 2 | [Task] | [Meeting name] | [Date/TBD] |

---

## Weekly Meeting Summaries

### 1. [Meeting Topic] — [Date]
**Attendees:** [Names] ([N] people)  
**Summary:** [1–3 sentences about what happened]  
**Decisions:** [Key decisions, or "None recorded"]  
**Action items:** [N items — list or "None"]  
**Follow-up needed:** [Yes/No — and what]

### 2. [Meeting Topic] — [Date]
...

[Continue for all meetings]

---

## Cross-Meeting Themes
[Recurring topics, people, or patterns worth noting]

- **[Theme 1]:** [Brief observation — appeared in [Meeting A], [Meeting B]]
- **[Theme 2]:** [Brief observation]

---

## Stats for the Week
- Total meetings with recordings: [N]
- External meetings: [N]
- Internal meetings: [N]
- Total action items generated: [N]
- Action items assigned to you: [N]
- Open items carried over from prior weeks: [N]

---

*Digest generated by COMM-zoom-digest. Data source: Zoom cloud recordings [date range].*
```

---

## Step 7: Save to Cloud Brain and Optionally Create Zoom Doc

**Save to Cloud Brain:**
- Tool: `mcp__cloud-brain__write_note`
- Path: `brain/digests/zoom-digest-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
- Content: full digest

**Create Zoom Doc (if user preference = Yes):**
Call `mcp__zoom__create_new_file_with_markdown`:
- `file_name`: "Weekly Meeting Digest — Week of [Mon Date]"
- `content`: full digest markdown

Provide the Zoom Doc link to the user.

---

## Step 8: Deliver the Digest

Present the digest and close with:

*"[N] meetings this week. [N] action items for you, [N] open loops carried over from prior weeks. Anything from this week's meetings you want to dive deeper on with a full debrief?"*

---

## Scheduling Note

This skill is designed to run automatically every Monday morning before the user's workday starts.

Recommended schedule: **Every Monday at 7:00 AM** (user's timezone).

When running as a scheduled task, the skill runs silently and saves the digest to Cloud Brain and/or Zoom Docs per preferences. No interactive questions — all inputs are read from saved preferences. If preferences haven't been saved yet, the scheduled run will alert the user to run the skill manually once to set them up.

---

## Error Handling

- **No cloud recordings in the period:** Report clearly and suggest enabling cloud recording if the user wasn't aware it was off.
- **Zoom AI summary unavailable for a meeting:** Use whatever data is available (recording metadata, title, duration, participants). Flag: "AI summary not available for this meeting — Zoom AI Companion may not have been enabled."
- **Large number of meetings (10+):** Generate full digest but offer a "top 5 most important" view based on meeting duration, number of attendees, and whether action items were generated.
- **Preferences not saved (scheduled run):** Skip interactive questions. Note at the top of the digest: "Default preferences used — run COMM-zoom-digest manually to customize your digest settings."
- **Prior digest not found in Brain (first run):** Skip the open items cross-reference. Note: "This is your first digest — no prior weeks to cross-reference. Open items from this week will be tracked in future digests."
