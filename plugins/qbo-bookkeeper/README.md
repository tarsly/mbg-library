## Getting Started (Brand New)

**Step 1:** Run the `penny-onboarding` skill — say **"set up Penny from scratch"**

Penny will walk you through:
1. Creating a free Intuit Developer account (browser only, ~2 min)
2. Building a QuickBooks app and configuring it (~5 min)
3. Submitting for production approval (Intuit reviews in 1–5 business days)
4. Running the one-time setup script to connect everything
5. Authorizing Penny to access your QuickBooks company
6. Verifying the live connection

---

## Already Have Credentials?

Run `setup-penny` instead — say **"connect Penny to QuickBooks"** or **"set up Penny"**.

---

## One-Time Setup Scripts

These run in Terminal once to configure Penny on your Mac:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `setup.sh` | Installs Python dependencies and securely stores your Intuit credentials |
| `add-to-mcp-config.sh` | Registers Penny with Cowork so it loads automatically |

After running both scripts, restart Cowork and run `qbo_authenticate` to complete the QBO connection.
