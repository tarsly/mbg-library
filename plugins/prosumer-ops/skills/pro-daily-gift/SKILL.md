# Daily Gift

## Overview

A small, well-targeted bit of content delivered once per day. Designed for solopreneurs who don't have time for a "morning newsletter" but want something to chew on. Four types:

1. **Quote** — short, ideally relevant to a current goal or struggle
2. **Article** — link to a single high-signal piece, with a 2-3 sentence preview
3. **Story** — short anecdote or case study (50-200 words)
4. **Illustration** — AI-generated image based on a current theme (uses pro-article-illustrate under the hood)

The pick is conditioned on Cloud Brain context — what you're working on, what you just journaled about, who you're meeting today. Not a generic "Quote of the Day" feed.

## When This Skill Applies

- User asks for a daily gift, morning gift, daily inspiration
- User wants a quick "thinking starter" for the day
- Calendar/routine trigger: morning brief, evening reflection
- User says: "give me something good", "what should I think about today", "gift me a quote"

## Pre-Flight — Preferences

Load `daily gift preferences` from `brain/preferences`:
- Preferred type rotation (quote / article / story / illustration — equal mix, or weighted)
- Themes you care about (entrepreneurship / family / fitness / Spanish / faith / RE — multi-select)
- Themes to avoid (politics / hype / news / etc.)
- Default send channel (display only / iMessage / WhatsApp / email)
- Quote sources you like (specific authors, books — pulls preferentially)

If not set, ask in ONE message and save.

```

## How It Works

### Step 1: Read Context from Cloud Brain

Pull recent context:
- `recent_activity` last 7 days
- `read_note` on active goals (`goals/` or `brain/goals.md`)
- `read_note` on current pulse / journal entries (`daily/`, `journal/`)
- Today's calendar focus (if available)

Identify 1-3 active themes: what's on the user's mind this week?

### Step 2: Choose Gift Type

If `--type` specified, use it.

Otherwise rotate per preferences. Default rotation: Mon: quote, Tue: article, Wed: story, Thu: quote, Fri: article, Sat: illustration, Sun: story.

### Step 3: Generate the Gift

**Quote:**
- Use WebSearch with theme-relevant query (e.g., "quote about persistence Charlie Munger")
- Filter for primary-sourced (book, talk, interview) — not "quote site" garbage
- Match against user's preferred authors if listed
- Surface ONE quote + brief context (source, when said)

**Article:**
- WebSearch for high-signal content on the theme published in last 7-14 days
- Prefer: known publications, authors user follows, sources Cloud Brain has prior notes from
- Fetch the URL via WebFetch
- Generate 2-3 sentence preview

**Story:**
- Generate a relevant anecdote (historical, case study, parable) — 50-200 words
- Tie to a current theme
- End with a question the user can chew on

**Illustration:**
- Invoke `pro-article-illustrate` with the active theme as the prompt seed
- Display the generated image inline (if MCP supports it) or save and report path

### Step 4: Optional Delivery

If `--send-as` is set:
- iMessage: use `comm-imessage-send` (from communications plugin)
- WhatsApp: use `comm-whatsapp-notifier`
- Email: use `comm-email-drafter` to create draft

### Step 5: Save

- **title:** `Daily Gift — {YYYY-MM-DD}`
- **folder:** `knowledge-base/gifts`
- **tags:** `["daily-gift", "{type}", "{theme}"]`

## Data Structure

```markdown
# Daily Gift — {YYYY-MM-DD}

> **Type:** {quote / article / story / illustration}
> **Theme:** {theme}
> **Tied to:** {goal or current focus from Cloud Brain}

## The Gift

{Quote / article preview / story / illustration here}

### Why this today

### Prompt to reflect

## Example Usage

**User:** "Give me a daily gift"

**AI:** Reads recent journal entries — user has been working on Warrior Thoughts launch. Rotates to "story" today per default. Generates a 150-word anecdote about a similar founder's launch. Saves.

**User:** "/pro-daily-gift --type quote --theme persistence"

**AI:** WebSearches for persistence-themed quotes from user's preferred sources. Picks one. Provides context. Saves.

**User:** "Send today's gift to Mary as an iMessage"

**AI:** Generates gift. Sends via iMessage (if communications plugin installed). Confirms send. Saves with channel logged.

**User:** "Daily gift — illustration only, theme is 'morning launch routine'"

**AI:** Invokes pro-article-illustrate with the theme. Returns image + caption. Saves.

## Error Handling

- **If Cloud Brain has no goals / no journal entries:** Use defaults from preferences themes, not personal context. Note: "Daily Gift personalizes from your goals + journal — set those up via `/gsd:add-todo` and `/brain-journal` for sharper picks."
- **If WebSearch returns mostly low-quality quote sites for quote mode:** Fall back to a curated set from Cloud Brain (if user has saved favorite quotes) or general well-known philosophers / strategists.
- **If article fetch fails:** Try alternate sources for the same theme. If all fail, fall back to quote.
- **If illustration generation isn't available (no image gen MCP):** Fall back to a different type with explanation.
- **If communications plugins aren't installed and user wants to send:** Display gift; tell user to copy/paste.
- **If user wants the same gift twice (dedup):** Check `knowledge-base/gifts/` for prior gifts within 30 days; pick a different one if duplicate.
- **If a gift would conflict with avoid-themes preferences:** Re-roll. Don't push politics / hype / news if user said avoid.
- **If user wants longer or shorter gift:** Override length. Don't deliver a 500-word "quote".
