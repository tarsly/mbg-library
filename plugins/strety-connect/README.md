# Strety Connect

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Publisher:** MyBusinessGenie
**Compatible with:** Claude / Cowork

## What This Plugin Does

Strety Connect wires Claude directly into [Strety](https://strety.com) — the EOS® software — via Strety's official REST API (beta). Manage your team's real To-Dos, Rocks, Scorecard, Issues, and Headlines from the terminal; walk into every L10 with a live prep pack; and mirror Strety into your Cloud Brain so the **EOS Operator** plugin's meeting runners work from the numbers your team actually sees.

Strety stays the system of record. This plugin reads and writes it surgically — no bulk two-way sync that could clobber teammates' edits.

## Skills Included

| Skill | What It Does | Example Triggers |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| **strety-setup** | One-time guided OAuth connection. Tokens stored locally (`~/.strety/`, chmod 600), auto-refreshed. | "connect Strety", "set up Strety" |
| **strety-todos** | List/add/complete/update To-Dos live in Strety. | "my Strety to-dos", "add a to-do in Strety" |
| **strety-rocks** | Rocks (Strety Goals): list with status, create, check in, milestones, backlog. | "rock status", "check in on my rock" |
| **strety-scorecard** | View the scorecard with 13-week trailing trend, log weekly numbers, add measurables. Flags 2-week misses. | "log my numbers in Strety", "how's the scorecard" |
| **strety-issues** | Issues List + Headlines: add, list top-3 IDS candidates, resolve, headline capture. | "add an issue in Strety", "resolve that issue" |
| **strety-l10-prep** | One-shot pre-meeting digest: scorecard, rocks, to-dos completion rate, top issues, headlines. Hands off to `/eos-level10`. | "prep my L10" |
| **strety-sync** | One-way Strety → Cloud Brain mirror in `eos-operator`'s note shapes. Incremental after first run. | "sync Strety", "refresh the EOS mirror" |

## Setup

1. Install the plugin, then run `/strety-setup`.
2. You'll create an OAuth app in Strety (**My Integrations → My Apps**), paste back the client ID/secret, and authorize in your browser. Two minutes, once.
3. Credentials live in `~/.strety/credentials.json` — local only, never written to Cloud Brain. Access tokens (2-hour life) refresh automatically.

## API Notes

- Base: `https://2.strety.com/api/v1` (JSON:API format; OpenAPI spec at `/api/docs/v1/openapi.yaml`)
- Rate limits: 10 requests / 10 seconds per token (the bundled helper backs off on 429 automatically)
- PATCH requires an ETag `If-Match` header — the helper handles this
- All API plumbing lives in `scripts/strety.sh`; skills stay thin

## Works Great With

- **eos-operator** — `/strety-sync` populates its Cloud Brain notes; `/strety-l10-prep` feeds `/eos-level10`
- **business-operations** — pipe Strety scorecard data into `/bizops-kpi-dashboard` reviews
