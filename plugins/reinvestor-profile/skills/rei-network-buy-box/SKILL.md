# Network Buy Box Manager

## Overview

Maintains a searchable database of real estate investors' buy boxes — specific acquisition criteria for each person in your network. Saves buyer profiles to cloud brain, matches incoming deals against the entire database, and drafts professional outreach to the best-fit buyers.

Built for wholesalers, deal finders, and investors who regularly need to move deals to the right buyer fast.

## When This Skill Applies

- User has a buyer's buy box to add or update
- User says "save this buyer's criteria" or "add to my buyer database"
- User wants to match a deal to potential buyers: "who in my network buys in Dallas?"
- User asks "find buyers for this deal" or "who should I call about this property?"
- User wants to draft outreach to matching buyers
- User asks "show me my buyer list" or "what does [Name] buy?"

## Pre-Flight — Identify Action

Determine what the user wants to do:

1. **Add/Update a buyer's buy box** → Section 1
2. **Match a deal to buyers** → Section 2
3. **Draft outreach messages** → Section 3
4. **View/search the buyer database** → Section 4

---

## Section 1: Saving or Updating a Buy Box

### Step 1: Extract the Data

Parse the provided text (pasted text, spreadsheet row, vCard, or conversational description) to extract:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Name | Yes | First and last |
| Company | Optional | |
| Email | Yes if available | Primary contact |
| Phone | Yes if available | |
| Geography | **Critical** | State, metro, radius (e.g., "50mi from Dallas"). If "nationwide," flag it. |
| Property Type | Yes | SFR, MF, commercial, land, mobile home park, etc. |
| Price Range | Yes | Min and max |
| Strategy | Yes | Flip, BRRRR, buy-and-hold, wholesale, etc. |
| Condition Tolerance | Yes | Turnkey, light rehab, heavy rehab, distressed |
| Acquisition Methods | Helpful | Cash, seller finance, Sub2, conventional, DSCR |
| Min Cash Flow / Cap Rate | Helpful | Investor's financial floor |
| Beds / Baths / Units | Helpful | Minimum or preferred |
| Deal Breakers | Helpful | Flood zones, HOA, etc. |
| Partnership Openness | Helpful | JV, co-wholesale, finder's fee |

**If key fields are missing** (especially Geography, Property Type, Price), flag them: *"I was able to save [Name]'s buy box, but I'm missing their [fields]. Worth following up to complete their profile."*

### Step 2: Handle Update Logic

- If user says "add to" or "augment" → **merge** new criteria with existing record for that contact
- If user says "replace" or "new buy box" → **overwrite** entirely
- If contact not found in brain → create new record

### Step 3: Save to Cloud Brain

```
Path: brain/buyer-network/[name-slug].md
Tool: mcp__cloud-brain__write_note
```

**File format:**
```markdown
# Buyer Profile: [Name]
**Company:** [Company]
**Email:** [Email] | **Phone:** [Phone]
**Last Updated:** [Date]

## Buy Box
- **Geography:** [Markets]
- **Property Type:** [Types]
- **Price Range:** $[Min]–$[Max]
- **Strategy:** [Strategies]
- **Condition:** [Tolerance]
- **Acquisition Methods:** [Methods]
- **Min Cash Flow:** $[Amount]/mo (if specified)
- **Min Cap Rate:** [X]% (if specified)
- **Deal Breakers:** [List]
- **Partnership Openness:** [Notes]
- **Other Notes:** [Anything else relevant]
```

Confirm to user: *"[Name]'s buy box saved. [X] buyers now in your network database."*

---

## Section 2: Matching a Deal

When user provides a property description and asks for matches:

### Step 1: Parse the Deal

Extract key attributes from the property description:

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Address / Location | [City, State] |
| Property Type | [SFR/MF/Land/etc.] |
| Price | $[Amount] |
| Condition | [Turnkey/Rehab/Distressed] |
| Beds/Baths | [X/X] |
| Estimated ARV | $[Amount] |
| Estimated Rent | $[Amount]/mo |
| Strategy Fit | [Best fits: flip / BRRRR / hold / wholesale] |
| Creative Finance | [Available or not, terms] |

### Step 2: Search the Buyer Database

Use `mcp__cloud-brain__search_notes` with queries:
- Property location (state, city)
- Property type
- Price range terms

Load all buyer profiles and compare deal attributes against each buyer's criteria.

**Matching Logic:**

| Match Level | Criteria |
|------------|----------|
| 🟢 **Strong Match** | Geography ✅ + Property Type ✅ + Price ✅ + Condition ✅ |
| 🟡 **Partial Match** | Geography ✅ + 2 of 3 remaining criteria ✅ |
| 🔴 **Weak / No Match** | Geography ❌ or 2+ criteria mismatch |

**Geography rule:** Geography is paramount. A deal in Dallas, TX matches buyers looking in "Texas," "DFW Metro," or "Dallas." It does NOT match a buyer looking only in "Houston" or "California."

### Step 3: Rank and Present Results

```
DEAL MATCH REPORT
Property: [Address] | Price: $[Amount] | Type: [Type] | Condition: [Condition]

STRONG MATCHES (X buyers)
──────────────────────────────────
1. [Name] — [Company]
   📍 Buys in: [Markets]   💰 Range: $[Min]–$[Max]   🏠 [Types]
   ✅ Why matched: [2–3 sentence explanation of specific fit]
   📞 [Phone] | 📧 [Email]

2. [Name] — [Company]
   [same format]

PARTIAL MATCHES (X buyers)
──────────────────────────────────
[Same format; note what didn't fully match]

BUYERS TO ADD TO YOUR PIPELINE
──────────────────────────────────
[Suggestion to reach out to specific buyers not currently in DB if this deal type is underserved]
```

## Section 3: Drafting Outreach Messages

For the top matching buyers, generate professional outreach:

**Default Template:**
```
Hi [Contact Name],

I hope you're doing well. I came across a deal in [Location] that looks like a strong fit for your acquisition criteria — specifically your focus on [Property Type] in [their stated market] under [their price cap].

Quick summary:
• Address: [Address]
• Type: [Type] | [Beds/Baths] | [SqFt]
• Price: $[Amount]
• [Key metric: rent, ARV, condition, creative terms if applicable]

I'm not taking this one down myself, but I thought of you immediately and wanted to see if you'd be open to connecting on it. No pressure — happy to send over the full details if there's interest.

Best,
[User Name]
[User Phone]
[User Email]
```

**If creative finance is available:**
> Add: "The seller is open to [seller finance / Subject-To] which I know fits your acquisition style."

**If outreach is for a wholesale assignment:**
> Add: "I have it under contract at $[price]. Assignment fee is $[fee]. Let me know if you want the full deal package."

**Tone adjustments:**
- For well-known contacts: More casual, reference past dealings
- For cold/new contacts: Professional, brief, lead with the deal not the relationship
- For lenders in the database: Frame as "I have a borrower who needs [X]" not "I have a deal"

---

## Section 4: View / Search the Buyer Database

When user asks "show me my buyer list" or "what does [Name] buy?":

**Full list:** Use `mcp__cloud-brain__search_notes` with query `buyer profile` to load all buyer records. Present as a summary table:

```
YOUR BUYER NETWORK ([X] buyers)

NAME              COMPANY          MARKETS           PRICE RANGE    TYPES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[Name]            [Company]        [Markets]         $[M]–$[M]      [Types]
[Name]            [Company]        [Markets]         $[M]–$[M]      [Types]
...
```

**Single buyer lookup:** Load `brain/buyer-network/[name-slug].md` and display full profile.

**Gap analysis:** If the user asks "who am I missing?", note any strategy/geography combos that are underrepresented. Example: "You have 8 buyers in DFW but none who buy multifamily there. That's a gap worth filling."

---

## Error Handling

- **No buyers in database yet:** Explain the database starts empty — add buyers by sharing their buy box criteria. Offer to add the first one now.
- **Multiple people with same name:** Use company name + phone to disambiguate; ask user to confirm.
- **Geography listed as "nationwide":** Save it but flag — "nationwide" buyers are rarely serious unless they have specific asset class focus. Ask if there's a preferred market they target most.
- **Buyer criteria are very generic (e.g., "buys anything under $500k in USA"):** Save but note: "Generic criteria mean this buyer may not respond to most deals. Try to get more specific criteria on your next call with them."
- **No matches for a deal:** Report honestly. Suggest: expanding to partial matches, adding buyers who specialize in that area, or adjusting the deal structure/price.
- **User asks to send the outreach directly:** Clarify this skill drafts only. For actual sending, use the `comm-email-drafter` skill or their preferred CRM.
