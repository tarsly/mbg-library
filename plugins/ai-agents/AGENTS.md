## About This Plugin

The AI Agents plugin is the system for building, activating, and managing an autonomous AI team. It covers the full lifecycle: design the org chart → activate agents with real tools → configure automated reporting → build custom skills when needed.

This plugin is the foundation of the MBG AI OS. Every other plugin plugs into it — Agent Activator reads the MBG plugin catalog to recommend the right skills for each agent task.

## Preferences Registry

The AI Agents plugin does not maintain a standalone preferences file. Team data (org charts, agent profiles, task lists, channel configs, reporting cadences) is stored per-company in Cloud Brain under the path `agent-teams/{company-slug}`.

The brain note for each company (`Agent Team: {Company Name}`) serves as the living record for all agent state. Agent Designer creates it; Agent Activator, Agent Reporter, and Agent Viewer all read and update it.

## Suggested Configurations

### Configuration A — Solo Operator (most common)
A single business owner who wants to delegate repetitive work to AI agents.

Recommended activation order:
1. **Agent Designer** — design the team (Executive Assistant, Marketing Agent, one domain-specific agent)
2. **Agent Activator** — activate the Executive Assistant first (highest impact fastest)
3. **Agent Reporter** — set up daily morning brief
4. Repeat activation for remaining agents

### Configuration B — Multi-Company / Investor
An operator with multiple businesses or investment portfolios who wants separate agent teams per entity.

Same flow as above, run once per company. Agent Viewer supports a multi-company "show all" view.

## Schedules Table

| Task Pattern | Skill | Suggested Schedule |
|---|---|---|
| Executive Assistant daily brief | Any skill the EA runs | Daily, 7:00 AM |
| Marketing content batch | content-social-calendar or custom | Weekly, Monday 7:00 AM |
| Financial report | Any finance skill | Monthly, 1st of month, 8:00 AM |
| Sales pipeline update | bizops-lead-tracker or GHL | Daily, 8:00 AM |
| Transaction coordinator check | real-estate-agent-pro:transaction-coordinator | Daily, 7:30 AM (active deals only) |

Schedules are created during Agent Activator (Phase 6) and Agent Reporter (Phase 4) using `mcp__scheduled-tasks__create_scheduled_task`.

## Tool Selection Framework

Agent Activator uses this decision order when equipping each task:

1. **MBG Plugin** — check `https://mybusinessgenie.ai/plugin-catalog.json` first
2. **Native Claude connector** — only if single-instance, connector exists, and multi-account is not needed
3. **Composio** — default for any external service where multi-account is possible or connector is missing
4. **Custom skill via Skill Builder** — for logic/automation tasks with no existing tool

Claude in Chrome is never recommended for agent tasks (not autonomous, requires human presence).
