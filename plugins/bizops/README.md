**Compatible with:** Claude / Cowork

## What This Plugin Does

BizOps is a complete business operations toolkit for small business owners across all industries. It covers the full operational loop: start the day, manage clients, track deals, handle money, build your team, document processes, and plan travel — all powered by a persistent AI brain that learns your preferences over time.

Every skill reads your saved preferences from memory on first run, so it adapts to your business rather than starting generic every time.

## Three-Phase Revenue Cycle

The pipeline and sales skills form a complete revenue cycle:

1. **Lead Tracker (Phase 0)** — capture and manage individual leads through your pipeline stages
2. **Pipeline Sync (Phase 1)** — analyze your pipeline: velocity, stale deals, revenue forecast, top deals to close
3. **Client Onboarding** — once a deal closes, immediately set up the client relationship

---

## Two-Phase Design

Some skills work best in pairs:

- **Pipeline:** `bizops-lead-tracker` (capture and track) → `bizops-pipeline-sync` (analyze and forecast)
- **Hiring:** `bizops-hiring-screener` (build the package) → use the scorecard during actual interviews
- **Clients:** `bizops-client-onboarding` (set up everything) → `bizops-follow-up` (track open items)

---

## Preferences Layer

Each skill that needs personalization checks Cloud Brain for a saved preferences note before running. On first use, it collects your preferences, saves them, and applies them going forward. You can update preferences at any time by saying "update my [skill] preferences."

**Preference notes are saved to:**  
`brain/preferences/[skill]-preferences.md`

---

## Memory Paths

This plugin reads and writes to the following Cloud Brain locations:

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `brain/preferences/` | Per-skill user preferences |
| `brain/projects/` | Client project files and onboarding checklists |
| `brain/pipeline/` | Deal and lead data |
| `people/` | Contact records |
| `brain/invoices/` | Invoice logs |
| `brain/drafts/` | Email drafts, agendas, welcome messages |
| `brain/sops/` | Standard operating procedures |
| `brain/budgets/` | Budget files with actuals |
