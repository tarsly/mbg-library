# Hiring Screener — Full Hiring Workflow Builder

## Overview

> **Disclaimer:** Employment laws vary significantly by state, province, and country. This skill provides general hiring guidance only. Consult an employment attorney or qualified HR professional before implementing any employment policies or making final hiring decisions.

Hiring Screener builds the complete hiring pipeline for any role. The user describes the position they need to fill — in as much or as little detail as they want — and AI generates a professional job description, ideal candidate profile, 10 tailored screening questions, interview scorecard, red and green flags to watch for, offer letter template, and a new-hire onboarding checklist. Designed for entrepreneurs and small business owners who do not have an HR department but need to hire like they do.

## When This Skill Applies

- User says "I need to hire a [role]" or "help me hire"
- User says "write a job description" or "create a job posting"
- User says "interview questions for [role]"
- User says "screening questions" or "hiring screener"
- User says "interview scorecard" or "candidate evaluation"
- User says "onboarding checklist" or "new hire onboarding"
- User says "offer letter" or "offer letter template"
- User says "ideal candidate profile" or "what should I look for in a [role]"
- User says "red flags in hiring" or "green flags"
- User says "hiring plan" or "hiring workflow" or "recruitment process"
- User says "hire a VA" or "hire a contractor" or "hire an assistant"
- User says "build a job post" or "write a listing"
- User mentions needing to fill a role or grow their team


## Pre-Flight — Hiring Preferences

1. Search Cloud Brain: `search_notes` with query `"bizops hiring preferences"` (folder: `brain/preferences`)
2. **If found:** Display as a table, confirm, then proceed
3. **If not found:** Ask in ONE message:
   - Business name and industry
   - Location / primary hiring market (city, state, remote-friendly?)
   - Typical roles hired (VA, sales, operations, technical, etc.)
   - Hiring style (internal HR / direct hire / agency / contract-first)
   - Any non-negotiable red flags specific to your business
   - Save to Cloud Brain: `write_note` → title: `bizops-hiring-preferences`, folder: `brain/preferences`
4. Apply throughout: use location for compensation benchmarks, industry for red/green flags, hiring style for process flow
5. Show banner at top of every output:
   ```
   👥 Hiring Screener | {Business Name} | {Industry} | {Location} | Preferences: ✓ loaded
   ```
   Add: *"Say 'update my hiring preferences' to change settings."*

## How It Works

### Step 1: Define the Role

Gather from the user's request:

1. **Role title:** What is the position called?
2. **Role type:** Full-time, part-time, contract, freelance, internship?
3. **Remote/on-site:** Where does this person work?
4. **Responsibilities:** What will they actually DO day-to-day?
5. **Reports to:** Who manages them?
6. **Budget:** Salary range or hourly rate (if the user is willing to share)
7. **Urgency:** When do they need someone by?
8. **Industry context:** What does the user's business do? (Use `search_notes` with "goals" or "projects" to check Cloud Brain for context)
9. **Team size:** How big is the current team? Is this the first hire, or adding to an existing team?
10. **Must-haves vs. nice-to-haves:** What is non-negotiable versus what would be a bonus?

If the user gives a short description ("I need a VA to handle my inbox and calendar"), expand it into a full role spec using industry standards for that position.

### Step 2: Generate the Job Description

```markdown
## Job Description

### [Role Title]

**Company:** [Company name from brain context or user input]
**Location:** [Remote / On-site / Hybrid — City, State]
**Type:** [Full-time / Part-time / Contract / Freelance]
**Compensation:** [Range or "Competitive, based on experience"]
**Reports To:** [Title]

---

#### About Us
[2-3 sentences about the company. Use `search_notes` with company name to pull from Cloud Brain if available. If not, draft from user context. Focus on mission and culture, not a Wikipedia entry.]

#### What You Will Do

#### How to Apply
[Instructions — email, application link, what to include (resume, portfolio, cover letter, specific task)]
```

Job description principles:
- Lead with what the candidate gets, not what you demand
- Avoid buzzwords ("rockstar", "ninja", "guru", "wear many hats")
- Be specific — "manage social media" is vague, "create and schedule 20 posts/week across Instagram and TikTok" is clear
- Include compensation range if possible — it attracts better candidates and saves time
- Keep requirements honest — do not list 10 years of experience for a junior role

### Step 3: Build the Ideal Candidate Profile

```

### Step 4: Create 10 Screening Questions

Develop 10 questions across four categories: experience, situational, behavioral, and culture fit.

```markdown
## Screening Questions

### Experience (Do they have the skills?)
1. **[Question about relevant experience]**
   - *What a great answer sounds like:* [Description]
   - *Red flag answer:* [Description]

2. **[Question about specific technical skill]**
   - *What a great answer sounds like:* [Description]
   - *Red flag answer:* [Description]

3. **[Question about industry knowledge]**
   - *What a great answer sounds like:* [Description]
   - *Red flag answer:* [Description]

### Situational (Can they think on their feet?)
4. **"You are given [realistic scenario for this role]. What do you do first?"**
   - *What a great answer sounds like:* [Description]
   - *Red flag answer:* [Description]

5. **"A client/customer is unhappy about [common problem]. Walk me through how you handle it."**
   - *What a great answer sounds like:* [Description]
   - *Red flag answer:* [Description]

6. **"You realize you are going to miss a deadline. What steps do you take?"**
   - *What a great answer sounds like:* [Description]
   - *Red flag answer:* [Description]

   - *What a great answer sounds like:* [Description]
   - *Red flag answer:* [Description]

8. **"Describe a project or task you are most proud of. What made it successful?"**
   - *What a great answer sounds like:* [Description]
   - *Red flag answer:* [Description]

### Culture Fit (Will they thrive here?)
9. **"What kind of work environment brings out your best work?"**
   - *What a great answer sounds like:* [Description]
   - *Red flag answer:* [Description]

10. **"What does accountability mean to you?"**
    - *What a great answer sounds like:* [Description]
    - *Red flag answer:* [Description]

### Bonus Question (The Differentiator)
11. **"If I gave you this job today, what would you do in the first 30 days?"**
    - *What a great answer sounds like:* [They have a plan, have researched the company, show initiative]
    - *Red flag answer:* [Vague, no preparation, waits to be told what to do]
```

Question design principles:
- Never ask "What is your greatest weakness?" or other cliche interview questions
- Situational questions must use realistic scenarios for THIS specific role
- Behavioral questions use "tell me about a time" format — past behavior predicts future behavior
- Include what a great answer AND a red flag answer look like so the interviewer knows how to evaluate
- The bonus question separates good candidates from great ones

### Step 5: Build the Interview Scorecard

```markdown
## Interview Scorecard

**Candidate Name:** _______________
**Role:** [Role Title]
**Interview Date:** _______________
**Interviewer:** _______________

### Scoring Scale
- **1** — Does not meet requirements
- **2** — Partially meets requirements
- **3** — Meets requirements
- **4** — Exceeds requirements
- **5** — Exceptional — top-tier candidate

### Evaluation

|----------|----------|:-----------:|-------|
| **Experience** | Relevant background for the role | | |
| **Technical Skills** | [Specific skill 1] | | |

| **Culture Fit** | Aligns with team values and work style | | |
| **Initiative** | Shows proactivity, asks good questions | | |
| **Reliability Signals** | Punctual, prepared, professional | | |

### Overall Assessment

### Step 6: Define Red and Green Flags

*Prepared by AI OS. This is a complete hiring package — adjust based on your specific needs, industry, and jurisdiction. For legal documents (offer letters, NDAs, non-competes), have an attorney review before sending.*
```

### Step 10: Present to User

Give the user:
1. The job description (ready to post)
2. The ideal candidate summary (who to look for)
3. The top 3 screening questions (most revealing)
4. Key red and green flags
5. Confirmation that the full package was saved to Cloud Brain
6. Suggestion: "Where are you posting this? I can adjust the tone for LinkedIn, Indeed, a freelancer platform, or your own network."

## Quality Standards

1. **Role-specific, not generic.** Every section must be tailored to the actual role described. A job description for a VA should read nothing like one for a sales director.
2. **Entrepreneur-friendly.** Written for business owners who do not have HR. No jargon, no overcomplicated process. Clear, direct, usable.
3. **Legally aware.** Include disclaimers where relevant (offer letters, employment type). Flag when the user should consult an attorney.
4. **Bias-conscious.** Job descriptions and questions should not include language that discriminates by age, gender, race, disability, or other protected characteristics.
5. **Practical.** The screening questions, scorecard, and checklists should be printable and usable in a real interview without further modification.
6. **Complete.** Every section of the hiring package is filled in. No "[TBD]" or empty sections.

## Output Format

A single comprehensive markdown document containing the full hiring package (job description, candidate profile, screening questions, scorecard, red/green flags, offer letter template, onboarding checklist). Typically 3,000-5,000 words. Saved to Cloud Brain in the `drafts` folder.

## Example Usage

**User:** "I need to hire a virtual assistant to manage my inbox, calendar, and social media scheduling"

**AI executes:**
- Expands "virtual assistant" into a full role spec based on the described responsibilities
- Generates: job description for a remote VA, candidate profile (organized, tech-savvy, proactive), 10 screening questions focused on organization and communication, scorecard, red/green flags for VA hiring, offer letter for a contractor, onboarding checklist for a remote hire
- Saves to Cloud Brain as `Hiring Package — Virtual Assistant {date}` in the `drafts` folder

**User:** "Hiring screener for a transaction coordinator in real estate"

**AI executes:**
- Builds a TC-specific package: industry knowledge requirements, real estate transaction experience, coordination and communication skills
- Screening questions focus on deal pipeline management, document handling, deadline tracking
- Red flags include poor attention to detail, inability to handle multiple transactions simultaneously
- Saves to Cloud Brain as `Hiring Package — Transaction Coordinator {date}` in the `drafts` folder

**User:** "I need to hire a content creator — someone who can shoot TikToks and Reels for me 3x per week"

**AI executes:**
- Builds a creative role package: portfolio requirements, platform knowledge, content calendar management
- Screening questions include "show me 3 videos you're proud of", "how do you stay on top of trends"
- Offer letter template set up as a freelance/contractor agreement
- Saves to Cloud Brain as `Hiring Package — Content Creator {date}` in the `drafts` folder

## Error Handling

- **If the user does not specify the role:** Ask: "What role are you hiring for? Give me a title and a rough description of what they'd do, and I'll build the full package."
- **If the user gives a very vague description:** Build the package with reasonable assumptions for the role, but flag: "I made some assumptions based on industry norms for this role. Review the responsibilities section and adjust anything that doesn't match your needs."
- **If the user asks for just one section (e.g., only interview questions):** Provide that section, but note: "I've generated the screening questions. Want me to build the full hiring package (job description, scorecard, offer letter, onboarding checklist) too?"
- **If a hiring package already exists for the same role and date in Cloud Brain:** Overwrite — the user is likely refining. Note: "Updated your existing hiring package for [role]."
- **If the user asks about salary ranges and does not provide one:** Research market rates via WebSearch for the role, location, and experience level. Present a range with sources. Note: "These are market rates — adjust based on your budget and the candidate's experience."
- **If the user wants to hire internationally or for a specific jurisdiction:** Add a note: "Employment laws vary by jurisdiction. The offer letter and employment terms in this package are general templates. Have a local attorney or HR consultant review before sending, especially for non-US hires."
