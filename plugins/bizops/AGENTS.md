## About This Plugin

`bizops` is a complete business operations toolkit for small business owners across all industries. It covers the full operational loop: start the day with clarity, manage clients and contacts, track leads and deals, generate invoices, monitor financial performance, track projects and vendors, build your team, document processes, and plan travel — all powered by a persistent Cloud Brain that learns your preferences over time.

**Target users:** Solo entrepreneurs, small business owners, and operations-focused professionals in any industry. Especially valuable for owners who want to systematize their business, get visibility into their pipeline and finances, and build the kind of operational infrastructure that lets them scale.

**Plugin version:** 1.1.0 (16 skills)

## Suggested Agent Configurations

**These are starting-point suggestions only.** Clients are free to design any configuration. Skills can be assigned to any agent in any combination. The goal is to match the configuration to how the owner actually thinks about their business.

---

### Option A: Solo Business Assistant (Most Common for Small Teams)

One "Business Operations Assistant" handles everything. Assign all 16 skills to one agent. Activation collects all preferences in one interview.

**Best for:** Solo entrepreneurs, early-stage businesses, owners who want simplicity over segmentation, or anyone who wants to start with one agent and split later.

**Activation interview:** All fields from the Preferences Registry above. Takes approximately 10–15 minutes once. All 16 skills pre-loaded and ready.

---

### Option B: Two-Agent Setup (Revenue + Operations)

**Revenue and Client Agent**
Skills: bizops-lead-tracker, bizops-pipeline-sync, bizops-client-onboarding, bizops-invoice-generator, bizops-follow-up, bizops-people

## How system-03 Should Use This Document

When a client's brain context indicates they are a business owner or operator (from system-02 business blueprint), system-03 should:

1. **Reference the Skills Catalog** to understand what capabilities are available — do not assume; check here.
2. **Surface capabilities based on what the client says they need** — not based on a fixed structure. If a client says "I need help staying on top of my finances," point them to bizops-financial-snapshot, bizops-budget-builder, and bizops-vendor-tracker specifically.
3. **Present the skill catalog as a menu of capabilities** the client can assign freely to whatever agents they create — they are not locked into any configuration.
4. **Use the Suggested Configurations as conversation starters**, not defaults. Show Option A, B, C, or D and ask: "Does one of these match how you think about your business, or would you like to customize?"
5. **Check Natural Pairings** in each skill entry when designing multi-agent setups — these are the highest-value skill combinations.
6. **Note the Phase 0/1 relationship** between lead-tracker and pipeline-sync — these are typically assigned to the same agent and explained together as a two-phase pipeline system.
7. **Prioritize daily-brief, follow-up, and weekly-review** for any agent configuration — these three form the operational backbone that keeps the owner connected to their business daily and weekly.

---

## How system-04 Should Use This Document

When activating an agent that has been assigned `bizops` skills:

1. **Identify which skills are assigned to this agent** from the system-03 design output.
2. **Look up each assigned skill in the Skills Catalog** to get its "Preferences collected at activation" list.
3. **Take the union of all preference fields** across all assigned skills — this is the complete set to collect. Do not run a separate interview per skill.
4. **Cross-reference the Preferences Registry** to understand which fields are shared across many skills (Core Identity, Sales and Pipeline) versus skill-specific (vendor alert window, travel preferences). Collect shared fields once.
5. **Run one consolidated setup interview** — not one per skill. Group questions naturally: "Let's start with your business basics, then your sales process, then a few financial and operational preferences."
6. **Write all preferences to a shared preferences file in Cloud Brain:**
   Each skill reads from its own path (e.g., `brain/preferences/bizops-financial-preferences.md`), but system-04 should write all relevant preferences in one interview session, routing fields to the correct note by skill domain.
7. **Reference the Recommended Schedules table** to suggest automated task cadences. Present the table to the client and ask: "Which of these would you like to run automatically, and which do you prefer to trigger on-demand?"
8. **Check if preferences already exist** before running the interview:
   ```
   mcp__cloud-brain__search_notes: "bizops preferences"
   ```
   If found, confirm with the client and skip that section — preferences carry across all agents in this plugin.
9. **After activation, confirm** which skills are live and what their schedules are. Give the client a one-line trigger phrase for each skill so they know how to use them.
10. **Highlight the Phase 0/1 pipeline system** at activation: "Lead Tracker captures your deals; Pipeline Sync analyzes them. Use Lead Tracker when you're working a deal; use Pipeline Sync when you want to see the big picture."
