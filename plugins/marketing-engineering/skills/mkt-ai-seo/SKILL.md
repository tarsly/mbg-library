# AI-SEO

## Overview

Traditional SEO gets you ranked. AI-SEO gets you **cited**. As more queries are answered by Claude / ChatGPT / Perplexity / Gemini directly (no clicks to your site), the strategy shifts: structure your content so LLMs can find it, parse it, trust it, and quote it with attribution.

Three modes:
1. **Audit** — find out how LLMs currently answer questions about your brand/category
2. **llms.txt generator** — produce a `llms.txt` file (the emerging standard) listing your most important pages with summaries
3. **Citation-ready content brief** — write a brief for content that's structured to be quoted by LLMs

## When This Skill Applies

- User asks about AI SEO / AEO / GEO / LLMO / getting cited by ChatGPT
- User wants to know how ChatGPT or Claude describes their company
- User wants to generate an `llms.txt` file
- User mentions: schema markup, structured data, JSON-LD, FAQ schema, llms.txt, AI search
- User asks how to write content that LLMs will quote
- User says: "AI SEO", "Answer Engine Optimization", "get cited by Claude/ChatGPT", "rank in AI"

## Pre-Flight — Preferences

1. Search Cloud Brain: `search_notes` for `"marketing engineering preferences"` in `brain/preferences`
2. **If found:** Load brand URL, offer, industry
3. **If not found:** Ask the same 5-question set as the other marketing skills
4. Banner:
   ```
   🎯 AI-SEO | Brand: {url} | Industry: {industry}
   ```

## How It Works

### Mode 1: Audit (default if no mode flag)

1. **Choose target queries** — either user-supplied via `--queries` or generated from brand + industry (default 10 queries):
   - "What is {brand}?"
   - "How does {brand} compare to {top 2 competitors}?"
   - "Is {brand} legit / trustworthy?"
   - "Best {category} for {audience} in 2026"
   - "Alternatives to {top competitor}"
   - "How much does {brand} cost?"
   - 4 more category-specific queries

2. **Test each query against LLMs the user can access.** Since we can't directly query GPT/Claude from a skill, this skill does its best via:
   - WebSearch with `chatgpt.com/{share-url}` patterns (limited)
   - WebSearch with `perplexity.ai` patterns (Perplexity often surfaces sources)
   - Generate a manual prompt set the user can paste into each LLM if direct testing isn't possible

3. **Analyze results:**
   - Was the brand mentioned at all?
   - Was it described accurately?
   - What sources were cited (if surfaced)?
   - What competitors were named instead?
   - What was the sentiment / framing?

4. **Score AI-SEO health:**
   - Visibility (cited in 0/3/5/8/10 queries)
   - Accuracy (factually correct? misattributed?)
   - Sentiment (positive / neutral / negative framing)
   - Source coverage (which 3rd-party sites are LLMs pulling from?)

5. **Output recommendations:**
   - Pages to add to llms.txt
   - 3rd-party sites to influence (Wikipedia, Crunchbase, Product Hunt, G2, niche directories)
   - Content topics to write to fill gaps
   - Schema markup to add to existing pages

### Mode 2: llms.txt Generator

Generates a properly-formatted `llms.txt` per the emerging spec (https://llmstxt.org). Structure:

```
# {Brand Name}

> {1-2 sentence brand summary — what you do, for whom, what makes you different}

## Docs

- [{Page title}](https://{url}): {1-line summary}
- ...

## Optional

- [{Page title}](https://{url}): {1-line summary}
- ...
```

Pull pages by:
1. Fetching brand sitemap if reachable at `/sitemap.xml`
2. Top pages from existing brand kit / preferences
3. Asking user to confirm before publishing

Recommend placing at `https://{domain}/llms.txt` and `https://{domain}/llms-full.txt` (full content version).

### Mode 3: Citation-Ready Content Brief

For a given topic, write a content brief structured for LLM citation:

- **Title pattern:** Question-shaped or "definitive" pattern ("What is X?", "How does X work?", "X vs Y: 2026 comparison")
- **Lead claim:** First paragraph contains the single most quotable claim, with a clear subject + verb + object
- **Named entities:** First mention of any person/company/concept is linked + has a defining phrase
- **Citations:** Every non-obvious claim links to a primary source
- **Bullets over prose:** LLMs preferentially quote lists
- **Schema:** FAQ schema (JSON-LD) for Q&A sections; Article schema for the page itself; HowTo schema for processes
- **Quote-ready blocks:** Insert 2-3 "tweetable" sentences that contain the brand + claim + outcome
- **Author authority:** Byline with credentials, link to Author Page with same schema
- **Update date:** Visible (LLMs weigh freshness)
- **Comparison tables:** Side-by-side tables with brand + competitors (LLMs love structured comparisons)

### Save

- **title:** `AI-SEO Audit — {brand} — {YYYY-MM-DD}` OR `llms.txt — {brand}` OR `AI-SEO Brief — {topic}`
- **folder:** `brain/marketing/audits` (audit), `brain/marketing/seo` (briefs and llms.txt)
- **tags:** `["ai-seo", "{brand}", "{type}"]`

## Data Structure

### Audit Output

```markdown
# AI-SEO Audit — {Brand} — {YYYY-MM-DD}

> **Queries tested:** {N}
> **Visibility score:** {N}/10
> **Accuracy score:** {N}/10
> **Sentiment:** {pos / neutral / neg}

## Query-by-Query Results

### Q1: "{query}"
- **Cited:** {yes / no}
- **How described:** "{snippet}"
- **Sources cited:** {urls}
- **Competitors named instead:** {names}
- **Notes:** {anomalies, hallucinations}

### Q2 ...

## Gaps Identified

- LLMs don't know about: {fact / capability / case study}
- LLMs misattribute: {wrong founder / wrong category / wrong year}
- Competitors over-indexed: {names — they're being cited where you should be}

## Action Plan

### This Week (Quick Wins)
1. Add llms.txt at /llms.txt
2. Add FAQ schema to /pricing
3. Update Wikipedia entry (if eligible)
4. Submit to Product Hunt / G2 / Crunchbase

### This Month
1. Write {topic} article (LLMs have no good source for this query)
2. Get cited on {3rd-party site} via {tactic}
3. Add Article + Organization JSON-LD to all top pages

### Quarterly
1. Build {N} comparison pages vs. competitors
2. Re-audit and track delta
```

### llms.txt Output

```markdown
# {Brand Name}

> {brand summary}

## Docs

## Example Usage

**User:** "Audit MBG for AI SEO"

**AI:** Generates 10 standard queries for MBG ("What is MyBusinessGenie?", competitors, pricing, etc.). Tests via web searches + Perplexity. Reports visibility, accuracy, gaps. Saves audit.

**User:** "/mkt-ai-seo --generate-llms-txt --brand mybusinessgenie.ai"

**AI:** Pulls brand sitemap + brand-toolkit summary. Generates llms.txt + llms-full.txt. Saves both. Provides install instructions for the user's static site or Next.js app.

**User:** "Write a content brief — 'how to use Claude Code plugins for real estate investing'"

**AI:** Generates citation-ready brief. Includes FAQ schema, quote-ready sentences featuring MBG, internal links to plugin docs. Saves.

**User:** "How does ChatGPT describe my company today?"

**AI:** Runs the 'what is {brand}?' query subset of audit. Reports back with verbatim snippets where available, gaps where not. Suggests llms.txt as first fix.

## Error Handling

- **If brand isn't well-known and LLMs don't return any data for queries:** That IS the audit result — visibility 0/10. Action plan focuses on first-pass discoverability (llms.txt, Crunchbase, directory submissions).
- **If we can't directly test LLM responses programmatically:** Generate the prompt set and ask user to paste into ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity, then paste results back. Audit the results.
- **If llms.txt generation requires pages we can't fetch:** Ask user to list their top 10 most important pages. Generate from that list.
- **If brand has a Wikipedia entry that's outdated or wrong:** Flag this as the highest-leverage fix — Wikipedia is heavily weighted by LLMs.
- **If user has a small site (<10 pages):** llms.txt should list ALL pages. Generate the full version, not a curated one.
- **If user wants to compete with a much larger brand in queries:** Be honest — AI-SEO can't make a 10-person company outrank Apple in 6 months. Recommend niche-specific queries instead ("Best Claude Code plugins for real estate investors" beats "Best AI tools").
- **If JSON-LD schema is complex:** Provide a minimal valid version; recommend Google's Rich Results Test for verification.
- **If user wants ongoing tracking:** Recommend re-running audit quarterly. Save audits with date-suffixed names for diff comparison.
