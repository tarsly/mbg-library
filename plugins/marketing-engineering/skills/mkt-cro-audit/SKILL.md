# CRO Audit

## Overview

Audits a single page (or URL) against a 12-point CRO framework and produces a prioritized fix list with estimated conversion lift. Output is saved to Cloud Brain so audits can be re-run quarterly and compared.

If `brand-toolkit` is installed, audit uses the brand voice and offer context for sharper recommendations. If `mkt-landing-page` is also installed, audit can generate replacement copy directly.

## When This Skill Applies

- User asks to audit a page ("CRO audit my homepage", "why isn't this landing page converting?", "review my pricing page")
- User pastes a URL and asks for feedback on conversion
- User mentions: CRO, conversion rate, A/B test ideas, page audit, landing page review
- User reports a drop in conversions and wants diagnostic

## Pre-Flight — Preferences

1. Search Cloud Brain: `search_notes` for `"marketing engineering preferences"` in `brain/preferences`
2. **If found:** Load, banner, proceed
3. **If not found:** Ask in ONE message:
   - Primary website / brand URL
   - Default offer (1 sentence — what you sell, to whom)
   - Primary CTA verb (Book / Buy / Subscribe / Get / Start / Try)
   - Average page conversion rate today (if known)
   - Industry / vertical
   - Save to Cloud Brain: `write_note` → title: `marketing-engineering-preferences`, folder: `brain/preferences`
4. Banner:
   ```
   🎯 CRO Audit | Brand: {url} | Offer: {offer} | Industry: {industry}
   ```

## How It Works

### Step 1: Fetch and Parse

`WebFetch` the URL. Extract:
- HTML structure (headings, sections, CTAs, forms)
- Visible copy (above the fold, below the fold)
- Form fields and length
- Images / video alt text
- Trust signals (logos, testimonials, badges, security indicators)
- Page weight indicators (if available via the response)
- Meta description, OG tags

If page is JS-heavy and WebFetch returns mostly markup, note the limitation and continue with what's visible.

### Step 2: Identify Page Type

If `--page-type` wasn't passed, infer from URL pattern and content:
- `/`, `/home` → homepage
- `/pricing`, `/plans` → pricing
- `/signup`, `/get-started` → signup
- `/{offer-slug}` with form above the fold → landing page
- `/features/{x}` → feature
- `/onboarding`, `/welcome` → onboarding

### Step 3: Score the 12 CRO Dimensions

| # | Dimension | What to check | Weight |
|---|-----------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Clarity | Above-the-fold answers "what is this, for whom, why now?" in <5 seconds | 12 |
| 2 | Headline | Outcome-focused, specific, addresses primary objection or desire | 10 |
| 3 | Primary CTA | Single dominant CTA, action verb, visually distinct, repeated | 10 |
| 4 | Social Proof | Logos, counts, testimonials with names/photos/results | 9 |
| 5 | Friction | Form length, required fields, click count to convert | 9 |
| 6 | Trust signals | Money-back, security badges, real address, support availability | 8 |
| 7 | Mobile | Layout, tap targets, form usability, scroll behavior | 8 |
| 8 | Speed (LCP/CLS) | Hero image, third-party scripts, font loading | 8 |
| 9 | Copy specificity | Numbers, named outcomes, vs. vague claims | 7 |
| 10 | Visuals | Hero shows the product/outcome; no stock-photo abstraction | 7 |
| 11 | Urgency / scarcity | Honest urgency (cohort closes, limited slots), not fake countdowns | 6 |
| 12 | Risk reversal | Guarantee, trial, cancel-anytime, refund policy | 6 |

Score each 0-10. Multiply by weight. Sum to 1000-point total.

### Step 4: Generate Fix List

For each low-scoring dimension, write a fix recommendation:
- **What's wrong** — 1 sentence
- **What to change to** — concrete copy or layout suggestion
- **Estimated lift** — low (1-3%) / medium (5-10%) / high (10-25%)
- **Effort** — quick (<1h) / medium (1-4h) / heavy (1+ day)
- **Why** — 1 sentence pointing to research / framework / heuristic

Sort fixes by lift / effort ratio. Top 5 are "do this week"; next 5 are "do this month".

### Step 5: Save Audit

- **title:** `CRO Audit — {domain}/{page slug} — {YYYY-MM-DD}`
- **folder:** `brain/marketing/audits`
- **tags:** `["cro-audit", "{page-type}", "{domain}"]`

Render the full audit in the note. Render the top-5 fix list in chat.

## Data Structure

| Element | What's there |
|---------|--------------|
| Headline | "{actual headline}" |
| Subhead | "{actual subhead}" |
| Hero | {image / video / nothing} |
| Primary CTA | "{button text}" → {url} |
| Trust signals | {logos / testimonials / badges / none} |
| Form (if any) | {N fields, required: {list}} |

## Example Usage

**User:** "Audit mybusinessgenie.ai for CRO"

**AI:** Fetches the URL. Identifies it as a homepage. Scores all 12 dimensions. Detects weak headline (vague), missing social proof, primary CTA below the fold. Top 5 fixes prioritized by lift/effort. Saves audit.

**User:** "/mkt-cro-audit https://warriorthoughts.com --page-type landing --goal 'waitlist signup'"

**AI:** Landing page audit. Goal: waitlist. Scores trust, urgency, friction harder for waitlist-specific patterns. Generates fix list for the signup-page CRO playbook.

**User:** "Why isn't my pricing page converting? It's at /pricing"

**AI:** Resolves the URL (from brand preferences). Audits pricing-page-specific dimensions (plan comparison clarity, anchor pricing, annual/monthly toggle visibility, money-back guarantee). Returns diagnostic + fixes.

**User:** "Re-audit the homepage I audited 90 days ago — show me what changed"

**AI:** Reads the prior audit from `brain/marketing/audits/`. Runs fresh audit. Diffs scores per dimension. Notes which prior fixes were applied. Shows lift gained / regressions.

## Error Handling

- **If WebFetch can't reach the URL:** Report and suggest checking the URL is public. Offer to audit a paste of the HTML.
- **If page is JS-heavy and WebFetch returns mostly empty markup:** Note the limitation. Audit what's visible. Recommend running through a headless browser (if `playwright` MCP is available) or pasting rendered content.
- **If URL is behind auth (signup wall, checkout flow):** Ask user to paste the rendered page or describe what's behind the wall.
- **If page is a paid landing page (Unbounce / Leadpages / similar):** Still works — note in audit which platform appears to be in use.
- **If the brand preferences aren't set:** Ask once. The audit needs the offer + audience to score copy specificity.
- **If user has `mkt-landing-page` installed:** End with: "Run `/mkt-landing-page --from-audit {audit note}` to generate replacement copy for the weak sections."
- **If user has `brand-toolkit` brand kit set up:** Use its voice rules when scoring copy ("does the copy match brand voice?"). Reference brand colors / typography for visual scoring.
- **If page has unusual format (one-pager scroll, interactive demo, video-first):** Adapt scoring — note that traditional CRO heuristics apply less. Score based on intent the page is built for.
- **If score is below 400/1000:** Recommend a full redesign rather than incremental fixes. Note clearly: "Below 400 means most fixes are rearranging deck chairs. Consider rewriting the page from scratch."
