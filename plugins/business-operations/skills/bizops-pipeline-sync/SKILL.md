# CRM Pipeline Sync

## Overview


> **Two-Phase Pipeline System — Phase 1:** Pipeline Sync is the intelligence and reporting layer. It reads the data captured by **Lead Tracker (Phase 0)** and produces analysis, forecasting, and deal recommendations. Use Lead Tracker to add and update deals; use Pipeline Sync to understand your pipeline.

Pipeline intelligence on demand. Pulls your deal pipeline data, analyzes it, and delivers a report that a $180K/year chief of staff would put on your desk every Monday morning. Total deals by stage, deal velocity (average days in each stage), stale deals flagged (no activity in X days), projected close dates, revenue forecast for the month and quarter, and the top 3 deals most likely to close this week. Works with deal data stored in Cloud Brain (pipeline folder) or can be extended to pull from Pipedrive, HubSpot, or any CRM with API access.

## When This Skill Applies

- User asks "how is my pipeline?" or "show me my deals"
- User wants to know which deals are closing soon
- User asks about stale deals or stuck deals
- User wants a revenue forecast
- User asks "what's my deal velocity?"
- User says "pipeline report" or "pipeline sync"
- User asks "which deals should I focus on this week?"
- User wants deals grouped by stage
- User asks for a CRM sync or CRM report
- User mentions Pipedrive, HubSpot, or any CRM data
- User asks "how many deals am I working?"
- User wants projected revenue for the month or quarter


## Pre-Flight — Pipeline Preferences

1. Search Cloud Brain: `search_notes` with query `"bizops pipeline preferences"` (folder: `brain/preferences`)
2. **If found:** Display as a table, confirm, then proceed
3. **If not found:** Ask in ONE message:
   - Business name and industry
   - Stale deal threshold (days with no activity before flagging)
   - Monthly / quarterly revenue target
   - Top-of-funnel goal (number of new leads per period)
   - Save to Cloud Brain: `write_note` → title: `bizops-pipeline-preferences`, folder: `brain/preferences`
4. Apply throughout: use stale threshold for all deal flags, revenue target for forecast gap calculations
5. Show banner at top of every output:
   ```
   🔄 Pipeline Sync | {Business Name} | Stale threshold: {X} days | Target: ${revenue} | Preferences: ✓ loaded
   ```
   Add: *"Say 'update my pipeline preferences' to change settings."*
   > Note: Lead Tracker and Pipeline Sync share the same preferences note.

## How It Works

### Step 0: Determine the Pipeline Source

Check for available data in this order:

1. **Local pipeline data in Cloud Brain:** Use `search_notes` with query "lead" to find individual lead/deal notes in the `pipeline` folder
2. **Pipeline dashboard:** Use `search_notes` with query "lead pipeline" for the dashboard overview
3. **KPI data:** Use `search_notes` with query "KPI dashboard" for metric cross-referencing
4. **External CRM (if configured):** Check for CRM API credentials or MCP server connections

If a specific pipeline name is provided (e.g., `/pipeline-sync real-estate`), filter leads to that category.

### Step 1: Gather All Deal Data

Use `search_notes` with query "lead" to find ALL lead notes in Cloud Brain. For each deal, use `read_note` to extract:

| Field | Where to Find It | Fallback |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| Name | Note title / `# Name` | Note title |
| Company | Contact Info table | "Unknown" |
| Stage | `> **Stage:**` line | "Unknown" |
| Deal Value | Deal Info — Estimated Value | $0 |
| Created Date | `> **Created:**` line | Note creation date |
| Last Updated | `> **Last Updated:**` line | Note modification date |
| Follow-Up Date | `> **Follow-Up Date:**` line | None |
| Next Action | Notes section (latest entry) | "None defined" |
| Source | Contact Info — Source | "Unknown" |
| Interaction Count | Count rows in Interaction History table | 0 |

### Step 2: Stage Analysis

Group deals by stage and calculate metrics for each:

**Standard Stages:**
| Stage | Definition |
|-------|-----------|
| New | Lead identified, no contact yet |
| Contacted | Initial outreach made, waiting for response |
| Qualified | Confirmed interest, fits criteria, worth pursuing |
| Negotiating | Active negotiation on terms, pricing, or scope |
| Proposal Sent | Formal proposal/offer submitted, awaiting decision |
| Closed-Won | Deal closed successfully |
| Closed-Lost | Deal did not close |

For each stage:
```
Count: {X} deals
Total Value: ${Y}
Average Days in Stage: {Z} days
Longest in Stage: {deal name} — {N} days
```

### Step 3: Deal Velocity Analysis

Calculate how fast deals move through your pipeline:

```
Average Time: New -> Contacted: {X} days
Average Time: Contacted -> Qualified: {X} days
Average Time: Qualified -> Negotiating: {X} days
Average Time: Negotiating -> Closed: {X} days
Full Cycle (New -> Closed-Won): {X} days average
```

Compare against benchmarks:
- If full cycle > 60 days: "Your sales cycle is long. Look for friction points in {slowest stage}."
- If full cycle < 14 days: "Fast pipeline. Make sure you're not leaving money on the table by rushing deals."
- If any single stage averages > 50% of total cycle: "Deals are getting stuck in {stage}. This is your bottleneck."

### Step 4: Stale Deal Detection

A deal is stale if:
- **No activity** (Last Updated) in 7+ days for active stages (Contacted, Qualified, Negotiating)
- **No activity** in 3+ days for Proposal Sent stage
- **Follow-up date is past** and no update has been logged
- **Been in the same stage** for more than 2x the average time for that stage

For each stale deal, flag it with:
- Deal name and value
- Days since last activity
- Current stage
- Recommended action (follow up, re-qualify, or drop)

### Step 5: Revenue Forecast

Calculate projected revenue for current month and quarter:

**This Month:**
```
Already Closed (this month): ${X}
Weighted Pipeline:
  - Negotiating deals x 60% probability: ${Y}
  - Proposal Sent deals x 40% probability: ${Z}
  - Qualified deals x 20% probability: ${W}
Projected Total: ${X + Y + Z + W}
vs. Monthly Target (from KPI Dashboard): ${target}
Gap/Surplus: ${difference}
```

**This Quarter:**
Apply the same weighted calculation, extending to the quarter. Factor in deal velocity to estimate how many current New/Contacted leads could convert by quarter end.

**Probability weights (conservative defaults):**
| Stage | Close Probability |
|-------|------------------|
| New | 5% |
| Contacted | 10% |
| Qualified | 20% |
| Negotiating | 60% |
| Proposal Sent | 40% |

### Step 6: Top Deals — Most Likely to Close This Week

Identify the 3 deals most likely to close in the next 7 days:

**Scoring criteria (weighted):**
| Factor | Weight | How to Score |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Stage (further = higher) | 30% | Proposal Sent = 10, Negotiating = 7, Qualified = 4 |
| Recent activity | 25% | Updated today = 10, last 3 days = 7, last 7 days = 4, older = 1 |
| Deal value | 15% | Higher value = higher score |
| Follow-up is imminent | 15% | Today/tomorrow = 10, this week = 7, next week = 4 |
| Interaction density | 15% | More interactions = higher score |

Rank all active deals by composite score. Present the top 3 with:
- Deal name, value, stage
- Why it is likely to close (specific signals)
- Recommended next action to push it over the line

### Step 7: Generate the Pipeline Intelligence Report

```markdown
# Pipeline Intelligence Report — {Date}

> **Total Active Deals:** {count}
> **Total Pipeline Value:** ${amount}
> **Weighted Forecast (this month):** ${amount}
> **Pipeline Health:** {STRONG / HEALTHY / ATTENTION NEEDED / CRITICAL}

```

### Step 8: Save and Report

1. Display the full report in terminal
2. Save the report to Cloud Brain using `write_note` with title `Pipeline Report {YYYY-MM-DD}`, folder `research`, tags `["pipeline", "report", "research"]`
3. If a KPI Dashboard note exists in Cloud Brain, update it with the latest pipeline numbers
4. Append a condensed summary to today's daily log using `write_note` with title `Daily Log {YYYY-MM-DD}`, folder `daily`:

```markdown
## Pipeline Sync — {time}

**Active Deals:** {count} totaling ${value}
**Weighted Forecast (month):** ${amount} vs. ${target} target
**Top Deal:** {name} — ${value} — {stage}
**Stale Deals:** {count} — ${value} at risk
**Action:** {#1 recommendation}
```

## Example Usage

**User:** "Show me my pipeline"

**AI:** Searches Cloud Brain for all lead notes in the pipeline folder, generates the full Pipeline Intelligence Report. Shows 12 active deals totaling $87K, 3 stale deals worth $22K that need follow-up, and identifies a $15K deal in negotiation as the #1 deal to close this week.

**User:** "/pipeline-sync"

**AI:** Same as above — full pipeline intelligence report with all metrics.

**User:** "Which deals are stuck?"

**AI:** Runs the stale deal detection (Step 4) and presents just the stale deals with recommended actions for each.

**User:** "What's my revenue forecast for this month?"

**AI:** Runs the revenue forecast (Step 5) and presents projected revenue from closed deals plus weighted pipeline, compared against the monthly target from the KPI Dashboard in Cloud Brain.

**User:** "What should I focus on this week?"

**AI:** Identifies the top 3 deals most likely to close (Step 6) and presents them with specific next actions. Also flags any stale deals that could be quick wins with a follow-up.

**User:** "/pipeline-sync real-estate"

**AI:** Filters deals to only those in the real estate category/pipeline and generates a focused report for that vertical.

## Error Handling

- **If no lead notes exist in Cloud Brain:** Report: "No deal data found. Your pipeline is empty. Use `/lead-tracker add [name]` to start tracking deals, or tell me about your current deals and I'll set up the pipeline."
- **If leads exist but none are in active stages:** Report: "All deals are either closed or no active deals exist. Here's the closed deal history: {summary}. Time to fill the pipeline — what leads are you working on?"
- **If no KPI Dashboard note exists in Cloud Brain:** Skip KPI cross-referencing. Note: "No KPI data found in your brain. Revenue forecasts won't be compared against targets. Run `/kpi-dashboard setup` to define targets."
- **If deal notes are in inconsistent formats:** Parse what you can. For fields you can't extract, use fallback values (listed in Step 1). Note which deals have incomplete data: "Heads up: {X} deal notes are missing key data (value, stage, or dates). Here's what needs cleaning up: {list}."
- **If no deals have been updated in 14+ days:** Lead with a warning: "WARNING: No pipeline activity in {X} days. Either you're not logging updates or deal flow has stalled. If deals are happening, update them. If they're not, that's the real problem."
- **If the user asks to sync with an external CRM (Pipedrive, HubSpot, etc.) but no integration exists:** Report: "External CRM sync is not configured. To connect Pipedrive/HubSpot, you'll need to add the relevant MCP server or API credentials. For now, I can work with deal data in Cloud Brain. Want me to analyze what's there?"
- **If the user references a pipeline name that doesn't match any leads:** List the available categories/pipelines: "I didn't find any deals in a '{name}' pipeline. Your current deals span these categories: {list}. Which one did you mean?"
