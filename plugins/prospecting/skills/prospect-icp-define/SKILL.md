# ICP Define

## Overview

Set up the buyer profile that every other prospecting skill — `prospect-find`, `prospect-enrich`, `prospect-bulk-list`, `prospect-handoff` — will read from. Multiple ICPs are supported, each saved as a separate note under `brain/icp/` in Cloud Brain. Skills that need an ICP either accept `--icp <name>` or default to the first one defined.

This is the prospecting equivalent of the `investor-profile` plugin's `buy-box` skill — same idea, applied to B2B sales.

## When This Skill Applies

- User wants to define who they sell to ("define my ICP", "set up my buyer profile")
- User wants to update or view their ICP ("update my ICP", "show me my ICPs")
- User is starting prospecting for the first time and no ICP exists yet
- Another prospecting skill (find, enrich, bulk-list) needs an ICP and none is defined → it should prompt the user to run this skill first
- User says: "ideal customer profile", "buyer profile", "who do I target"

## Pre-Flight — Preferences

This skill IS the preferences for the prospecting plugin. There's no upstream preference to load — but check whether ICPs already exist:

1. `list_directory` → folder `brain/icp/`
2. **If ICPs exist:** Show the list with names, summary lines, last-updated dates. Ask: "Add a new ICP, update one, or just view? (new / update / view)"
3. **If none exist:** Proceed straight to the define flow.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Gather ICP Details

Ask in ONE message (don't drip the questions one at a time):

| Field | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| ICP nickname | `agency-clients`, `re-sellers-utah`, `podcast-guests-real-estate` |
| Industries (one or more) | "SaaS", "Real estate brokerages", "Med spas in Utah" |
| Job titles (one or more) | "Founder", "CMO", "Head of Growth" |
| Company size | "1-10 employees", "11-50", "51-200", "200+", or "any" |
| Annual revenue range | "$1M-$10M", or "any" |
| Geography | "US only", "Utah + Indiana", "English-speaking", "global" |
| Tech stack signals | "uses HubSpot", "WordPress site", "has a Calendly link" |
| Buying triggers | "recently raised", "hired a VP of Sales", "launched a podcast" |
| Disqualifiers | "competitors", "Big 4 consulting", "agencies (if you ARE one)" |
| What they need from you | 1-2 sentences — the pain you solve |
| Avg deal size | "$5K-$25K", "$50K+", "TBD" |

Optional advanced fields (offer but don't require):
- Personas within the company (champion vs. economic buyer vs. influencer)
- Preferred outreach channel (email / LinkedIn / phone / mail)
- Anti-personas — people NOT to talk to even in target companies

### Step 2: Save the ICP

Use `write_note`:
- **title:** `ICP — {nickname}`
- **folder:** `brain/icp`
- **tags:** `["icp", "{nickname}"]`

Use the template in Data Structure.

### Step 3: Confirm and Cross-Link

After saving:
- Render a clean summary of the ICP
- Show next-step suggestions:
  - "Run `/prospect-find --icp {nickname}` to start finding matches"
  - "Run `/prospect-bulk-list --icp {nickname} --count 50` to generate a starting list"

If this is the user's first ICP, also update `brain/preferences/prospecting-preferences` (create if missing) to mark this as the default ICP.

## Data Structure

```markdown
# ICP — {nickname}

> **Created:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
> **Updated:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
> **Default ICP:** {yes / no}

## Target Profile

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Industries | {comma list} |
| Job Titles | {comma list} |
| Company Size | {range} |
| Revenue Range | {range or "any"} |
| Geography | {regions} |
| Tech Stack Signals | {tools / signals} |
| Buying Triggers | {events that suggest readiness} |
| Disqualifiers | {who NOT to target} |

## What They Need

{1-2 sentence pain description and how you solve it}

## Deal Economics

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Avg Deal Size | ${range} |
| Sales Cycle | {days / weeks / months} |
| Decision Maker | {title} |
| Influencers | {titles} |

## Personas (Optional)

### Champion
- {role / pain / what they want}

### Economic Buyer
- {role / pain / what they want}

### Influencer
- {role / pain / what they want}

## Outreach Preferences

- Preferred channel: {email / LinkedIn / phone / mail}
- Best time to reach: {time of day / day of week if known}
- Anti-personas: {who in target companies NOT to message}

## Notes

- {YYYY-MM-DD}: ICP created.
```

## Output Format

```
✓ ICP saved: {nickname}

INDUSTRIES: {list}
TITLES: {list}
COMPANY SIZE: {range}
GEO: {regions}
DEAL SIZE: ${range}

NEXT STEPS
1. Find matching contacts: /prospect-find --icp {nickname}
2. Generate a target list:  /prospect-bulk-list --icp {nickname} --count 50
3. Enrich a known contact:  /prospect-enrich [name] --company [company]
```

## Example Usage

**User:** "Define my ICP"

**AI:** Lists existing ICPs (if any). Asks the 11-field ICP question in ONE message. Saves to Cloud Brain. Shows next steps.

**User:** "Set up an ICP for my agency — SMBs that need AI automation"

**AI:** Pre-fills industries (SMBs, professional services), titles (Founder, COO), suggests buying triggers (recent funding, new hires, "AI" in social posts). User confirms or edits. Saves.

**User:** "/prospect-icp-define re-sellers-utah --industry 'real estate, single-family homes' --title 'Homeowner, Landlord' --geo 'Utah' --buying-triggers 'expired listing, recent divorce, probate, tax lien'"

**AI:** Creates `ICP — re-sellers-utah` immediately from arguments. Asks for any missing fields. Saves.

**User:** "Show my ICPs"

**AI:** Lists all `brain/icp/` notes with name, industries, titles, last-updated dates. Asks which to view in full.

**User:** "Update my agency-clients ICP to add 'launched a podcast in last 90 days' as a buying trigger"

**AI:** Reads existing ICP, appends to buying triggers, saves.

## Error Handling

- **If user names an ICP that conflicts with existing one:** Confirm "An ICP called {name} already exists. Replace it, update it, or pick a different name?"
- **If user provides too-vague fields (e.g., "anyone", "all")**: Ask for one more constraint. ICPs that match everything match nothing.
- **If user says "I don't know yet" for several fields:** Save what they have, mark missing fields as `TBD`, and flag: "This ICP has gaps. Other prospecting skills will work but will produce broader lists. Fill in `TBD` fields when you have more data."
- **If geography is given but no region/state is named:** Ask "Specific countries, states, or metros? 'US' is fine; 'global' is fine; 'undefined' won't work for list generation."
- **If user already has 5+ ICPs:** Ask "You have {N} ICPs. Are these all active, or should we archive some? Too many ICPs usually means none are tight enough."
- **If the user's prior ICP is RE-specific and they have `investor-profile` installed:** Note: "You have a real-estate buy box in `investor-profile`. Want this ICP to extend that, or keep them separate? Same fields can stay in sync."
