# Prospect Enrich

## Overview

Single-contact enrichment. Where `prospect-find` returns many partial matches, `prospect-enrich` takes ONE known person and fills in everything you can find. Built for the "I have a name, give me the email" moment before outreach.

Provider routing:
- Best email-finding → Hunter (or Apollo as fallback)
- Best mobile phone → Lusha (or ZoomInfo)
- Best buying signals → ZoomInfo / Apollo
- Web fallback always available

## When This Skill Applies

- User has a name (and maybe company) and needs contact info ("get me {name}'s email", "enrich Sarah Chen at Acme")
- User pasted a LinkedIn profile and wants to message but doesn't have email
- User mentions a person and asks to "look them up" or "find their email"
- User says: "enrich", "find email", "find phone", "verify email", "look up contact"

## Pre-Flight — Preferences

Reads from `prospecting-preferences` (set up by `prospect-find` or this skill on first run):
- Available providers
- Verified-email policy (require / best-effort)
- Auto-save enriched contacts to `pipeline/` or just return inline

If preferences not set, ask the same questions as `prospect-find` and save them once.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Resolve Identity

Minimum required: `name`. Strongly recommended: at least one of `company`, `domain`, `linkedin`.

If only a name is provided, ask once: "What company is {name} at, or do you have their LinkedIn URL? Without one of those, I'll get false positives on common names."

Skip the ask if name is rare enough (e.g., "Owen Mecham") or context implies a known person from a recent thread.

### Step 2: Check Cloud Brain First

`search_notes` for the name. If a recent enrichment exists (< 30 days old):
- Show what's already known
- Ask: "I have enrichment data from {date}. Refresh, or use cached?"

This saves API calls and respects provider quotas.

### Step 3: Provider Cascade

Run providers in priority order until all needed fields are filled, OR all providers exhausted:

**For work email:**
1. Hunter (`email-finder` by name + domain)
2. Apollo (`people/match`)
3. Vibe Prospecting (match flow)
4. Web fallback (`site:{domain} "{name}"`, parse mailto links; common email patterns: firstname.lastname@domain, first@domain, flast@domain)

**For verified email:**
1. Hunter (`email-verifier`)
2. Apollo (verified flag in person object)
3. Skip verification gracefully if no verifier MCP — note as "best-effort"

**For phone:**
1. Lusha (preferred for mobile)
2. ZoomInfo
3. Apollo (direct dial)
4. Web fallback rarely useful for phones — note as unavailable

**For LinkedIn:**
1. Any provider that returns LinkedIn URL in person object
2. Web fallback: `site:linkedin.com/in/ "{name}" "{company}"`

**For title / current role:**
1. Any provider
2. Web fallback: LinkedIn snippet, company team page

**For buying signals:**
1. Apollo / ZoomInfo (built-in intent data)
2. Otherwise: skip (this skill won't synthesize signals — that's what `brief-person-30days` is for)

### Step 4: Verify Email (Optional)

If `--verify-email` or preferences require verification:
- Use email-verifier MCP (Hunter has one)
- Mark each email as `verified | catch-all | risky | invalid`
- Drop invalid; flag catch-all and risky

### Step 5: Render and Save

Render the enrichment table inline. Save if preferences say so.

If a contact note exists in `people/`, update it. Otherwise, offer to create one but don't auto-create.

If the enrichment is for a known lead in `pipeline/`, append to the lead's note as a new "Enriched contact info" section.

## Example Usage

**User:** "Get me Sarah Chen's email — she's at Acme AI"

**AI:** Checks Cloud Brain for cached enrichment. None. Detects Hunter. Runs `email-finder` with name + domain `acme.ai`. Returns `sarah@acme.ai` (verified). Renders enrichment. Offers to save.

**User:** "/prospect-enrich Marcus Lee --linkedin linkedin.com/in/marcuslee --verify-email"

**AI:** Pulls LinkedIn URL → resolves company. Runs Hunter for email, verifier for verification. Renders.

**User:** "Look up Peter Steinberger"

**AI:** Name is recognizable; doesn't ask for company. Runs web fallback (no enrichment MCP needed for a public person) → returns X handle, GitHub, current company from LinkedIn snippet.

**User:** "Find email for everyone in my Prospect List — agency-clients — 2026-06-20"

**AI:** Stops. Says: "This is a bulk enrichment — use `/prospect-find` to refresh the list with verified emails. This skill is for single contacts."

## Error Handling

- **If name is too common and no company/domain/LinkedIn given:** Ask once. If user insists, do best effort but warn: "I'm going to guess. Wrong-person risk is high. Add `--company` or `--linkedin` for confidence."
- **If no provider MCP is available and web fallback returns nothing:** Honest report: "No email found via web. Install Hunter or Apollo for better coverage." Don't fabricate.
- **If email pattern is guessed but unverified:** Mark clearly as `best-effort, not verified`. Suggest verifying via Hunter or by sending a test email.
- **If person has clearly changed companies (LinkedIn says X, provider says Y):** Show both, prefer the more recent source. Note discrepancy: "LinkedIn shows {X}, {provider} shows {Y}. Verify before outreach."
- **If user has a `bizops-lead-tracker` lead for this person:** Append enrichment to the lead note. Don't overwrite — append.
- **If the person is in a privacy-conscious region (GDPR EU, Canada) and only personal email is available:** Note the legal context: "Found personal email but cold outreach to EU residents requires opt-in basis under GDPR. Use sparingly."
- **If the provider returns multiple matches (same name, different companies):** Show all and ask which to enrich. Never pick silently.
- **If the user asks for an email that's an obvious private/personal address (e.g., @gmail.com for someone at a real company):** Surface both — many founders prefer Gmail. Note which is which.
