## What This Plugin Does

REInvestor Toolbox is a complete deal acquisition toolkit for active real estate investors. It handles the full workflow from researching a property to drafting the offer — and everything in between.

Every skill reads your saved investor preferences from the first run, so you never re-enter your name, targets, or thresholds. Each skill also saves its output to cloud brain, meaning skills can hand off to each other automatically. Run property research → it pre-loads into deal analysis. Run deal analysis → it pre-loads into the investment calculator and offer generator.

## Skills Included

### rei-property-research
Research any property address — ownership, tax records, estimated value, sale history, comparable sales, neighborhood analysis, school ratings, flood zones, and seller motivation scoring (1–5 scale based on equity, listing history, delinquency, and absentee status).

**Trigger phrases:** "research this address," "pull property info," "who owns this," "what's this house worth," "run property research"

### rei-deal-analyzer
Full go/no-go analysis scored against your saved buy box. Pulls cap rate, cash-on-cash return, DSCR, cash flow, equity position, and a color-coded scorecard comparing every metric to your personal targets (not generic benchmarks). Auto-loads prior property research from brain.

**Trigger phrases:** "analyze this deal," "run the numbers," "does this deal work," "cash flow analysis," "cap rate on this property"

### rei-investment-calculator
Deep financial modeling: BRRRR, flip P&L, buy-and-hold projections (5/10/20/30 year), refinance analysis, seller finance amortization, lease-option analysis, and side-by-side scenario comparison. Includes depreciation estimates, equity build-up curves, and an opportunity cost comparison (same cash in S&P 500 and HYSA vs. real estate).

**Trigger phrases:** "run BRRRR analysis," "flip numbers," "amortization table," "10-year projection," "refinance analysis," "model this deal"

### rei-rental-analysis
Five-strategy rental comparison (long-term, Section 8, midterm/furnished, Airbnb/STR, co-living) with weighted scoring, 5-year income projection comparing top two strategies, STR legality check, HUD Fair Market Rent data, and strategy recommendation aligned with your saved preferences.

**Trigger phrases:** "what can I rent this for," "Airbnb vs. long-term," "rental analysis," "Section 8 rates," "rent comps," "midterm rental potential"

### rei-seller-outreach
Personalized outreach drafts for every channel — physical letters, text/SMS, voicemail scripts, emails, and cold call frameworks. Handles pre-foreclosure, probate, absentee owner, tired landlord, tax delinquent, vacant, divorce, and estate situations. Reads your saved contact info and brand voice so every piece is ready to send.

**Trigger phrases:** "write a letter to this seller," "draft outreach," "cold call script," "text this owner," "yellow letter," "seller communication"

### rei-deal-marketing
Complete marketing package for any deal — one-page deal summary, social media posts (Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter), Instagram Story/Reel script, email blast, investor narrative pitch, and listing descriptions (short and long). Reads verified deal numbers from brain when available.

**Trigger phrases:** "market this deal," "one-pager," "deal summary," "social media posts," "email blast," "investor pitch," "listing description"

### rei-offer-generator *(New)*
Generates a full offer package: Letter of Intent (LOI), purchase price justification, and creative finance term sheet for seller finance or subject-to deals. Pre-loads deal analysis numbers from brain. Includes retail-sale comparison table to support the offer price with a seller.

**Trigger phrases:** "draft an LOI," "make an offer," "offer letter," "seller finance term sheet," "subject-to offer," "present this offer"

### rei-due-diligence-tracker *(New)*
Contract-to-close deadline tracker. Enter a close date and contingency periods — the skill calculates every critical date (EMD, inspection, financing, appraisal, title review, walk-through, close), assigns urgency (🚨 RED / ⚠️ YELLOW / 🟢 GREEN), and saves a live status file to brain. Dashboard view across all active transactions when you ask "what's due this week?"

**Trigger phrases:** "we're under contract," "set up contract tracking," "what deadlines are due," "mark inspection complete," "show my open transactions," "what's due this week"

## Two-Phase Design

Several skills form a natural pipeline:

```
rei-property-research  →  rei-deal-analyzer  →  rei-investment-calculator
                                ↓                        ↓
                     rei-rental-analysis        rei-offer-generator
                                                         ↓
                                             rei-due-diligence-tracker
                                                         ↓
                                              rei-deal-marketing
```

Each skill saves its output to cloud brain at a standardized path. The next skill in the pipeline reads that output automatically — no copy/paste required.

## Investor Preferences

On your first run of any skill, you'll be asked to set up your investor profile:

- **Name and contact info** (used in outreach and marketing materials)
- **Target markets** (1–3 cities or states)
- **Strategy focus** (LTR, BRRRR, flip, creative finance, etc.)
- **Property types** (SFR, multifamily, commercial, etc.)
- **Target price range**
- **Minimum cash flow per door**
- **Target cash-on-cash return**
- **Target cap rate**
- **Minimum DSCR**
- **Financing preference**
- **Brand voice** (for outreach and marketing)

Preferences are saved to `brain/preferences/rei-preferences.md` and auto-applied by every skill from that point on. You'll see a ⚙️ banner at the top of each output confirming your active preferences. To update preferences, say "update my investor preferences."

## Updating Your Preferences

Say "update my REI preferences" at any time. The skill will load your current preferences, display them, and ask which you want to change.
