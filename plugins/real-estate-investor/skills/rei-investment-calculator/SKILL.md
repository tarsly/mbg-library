# REI Investment Calculator

> **Disclaimer:** This skill produces financial models for informational and planning purposes only. It is not a substitute for advice from a licensed financial advisor, CPA, or lender. Tax estimates are illustrative only — consult a qualified tax professional before making tax-related decisions. All projections should be independently verified before investing.

## Overview

A comprehensive real estate financial modeling engine. Not just mortgage math — this produces full financial models with amortization tables, equity build-up curves, tax benefit estimates, and multi-year projections. Use this **after** `rei-deal-analyzer` has confirmed a deal is worth pursuing. Reads prior deal analysis from cloud brain when available to avoid re-entering data.

**Analysis types supported:**
1. BRRRR (Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat)
2. Flip profit/loss
3. Buy-and-hold projections (5/10/20/30 year)
4. Refinance analysis (current vs. new terms)
5. Seller finance amortization
6. Lease-option analysis (buyer and seller perspectives)
7. Side-by-side scenario comparison

## When This Skill Applies

- User asks for BRRRR analysis on a property
- User wants flip profit/loss calculated
- User asks for buy-and-hold projections over multiple years
- User needs a refinance analysis (current vs. new terms)
- User wants an amortization table or schedule
- User asks about seller finance terms and payment breakdowns
- User needs lease-option analysis (from buyer or seller side)
- User wants to compare two or more investment scenarios side by side
- User asks "what are my returns over 10 years?"
- User wants to see equity build-up over time
- User asks about tax benefits, depreciation, or cost segregation
- User needs a balloon payment or payoff calculation

## Pre-Flight — Investor Preferences

1. Use `mcp__cloud-brain__search_notes` with query `REI preferences`
2. **If found:** Load preferences. Display ⚙️ banner with investor name and key thresholds.
3. **If not found:** Run preferences setup (same as rei-deal-analyzer). Save to `brain/preferences/rei-preferences.md`.
4. **Check for prior deal analysis:** Use `mcp__cloud-brain__search_notes` with any address/deal slug mentioned. If found, load it and note: "Found saved deal analysis from {date} — pre-loading those inputs."

## Core Calculation Engine

**Monthly Payment (fully amortizing)**
```
M = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n − 1]
P = principal | r = monthly rate (annual/12) | n = total payments (years×12)
```

**Monthly Payment (interest-only)**
```
M = P × r
```

**Remaining Balance at Month X**
```
B(x) = P × [(1+r)^n − (1+r)^x] / [(1+r)^n − 1]
```

**Total Interest Over Life of Loan**
```
Total Interest = (M × n) − P
```

---

## Analysis Type 1: BRRRR

**Phase 1 — Buy & Rehab**
```
Total Acquisition Cost = Purchase Price + Rehab + Closing Costs (buy 2–3%) + Holding Costs
Holding Costs = Monthly carrying cost × rehab timeline (months)
```

**Phase 2 — Rent**
```
Monthly Cash Flow = Rent − Vacancy − Expenses − Debt Service
Stabilized NOI = Annual cash flow before debt service
```

**Phase 3 — Refinance**
```
Refinance Amount = ARV × LTV% (typically 70–80%)
Cash Recouped = Refinance Amount − Original Loan Payoff − Refi Closing Costs
Cash Left in Deal = Total Acquisition Cost − Cash Recouped
```

**Phase 4 — Repeat Assessment**
```
New Monthly Cash Flow = Rent − Vacancy − Expenses − New Payment
Cash-on-Cash (on cash left in deal) = Annual Cash Flow / Cash Left in Deal
Infinite Return = Cash Left in Deal ≤ 0
```

**BRRRR Summary Table:**

| Phase | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Purchase Price | |
| Rehab Cost | |
| Closing Costs (buy) | |
| Holding Costs | |
| **Total Investment** | |
| ARV | |
| Refinance LTV | |
| Refinance Loan Amount | |
| Payoff Original Loan | |
| Refi Closing Costs | |
| **Cash Back at Refi** | |
| **Cash Left in Deal** | |
| Monthly Rent | |
| Monthly Expenses + New Payment | |
| **Monthly Cash Flow** | |
| **Cash-on-Cash Return** | |
| **Infinite Return?** | Yes / No |

## Analysis Type 3: Buy-and-Hold Projections (5/10/20/30 Year)

Year-by-year table (adjustable assumptions):
- Annual rent growth: 3% (conservative) / 4% (moderate) / 5% (aggressive)
- Annual appreciation: 3% / 4% / 5%
- Annual expense growth: 2%

| Year | Rent | Expenses | NOI | Debt Service | Cash Flow | Property Value | Loan Balance | Equity | Total Return |

## Tax Benefit Calculations

**Depreciation (Residential)**
```
Depreciable Basis = Purchase Price − Land Value (typically 20%) + Improvements
Annual Depreciation = Depreciable Basis / 27.5 years
Tax Savings = Annual Depreciation × Marginal Tax Rate
```

**Depreciation (Commercial)**
```
Annual Depreciation = Depreciable Basis / 39 years
```

**Cost Segregation Estimate**
```
Personal property (5-year): ~15–25% of building value
Land improvements (15-year): ~5–15% of building value
Year 1 Bonus Depreciation Impact: [estimated additional tax savings vs. straight-line]
```

*Tax estimates are illustrative only. Consult a CPA before making tax-related decisions.*

## Error Handling

- **Analysis type ambiguous:** Infer from context ("rehab + refi" = BRRRR; "ARV + sell" = flip; "rent + hold" = buy-and-hold). Ask if still unclear.
- **Missing inputs:** List specifically what's needed for the chosen analysis type.
- **Negative cash flow / returns:** Show what price, rent, or terms would hit the investor's saved targets.
- **Unrealistic inputs:** Flag with note; proceed as-is.
- **30-year amortization table requested:** Show annual summaries (30 rows) by default; offer full 360-row monthly detail.
- **Balloon scenario without exit plan:** Calculate balloon amount and flag — "At the balloon date, balance will be $X. Plan for refinance, payoff, or extension."
- **Comparing scenarios across different markets:** Note that the comparison reflects both deal terms and market differences, not terms alone.
