# REI Property Research

> **Disclaimer:** This skill produces research and analysis for informational purposes only. It is not a substitute for advice from a licensed real estate professional, attorney, or appraiser. All data should be independently verified before making investment decisions.

## Overview

Performs a comprehensive deep dive on any property address. Uses web search to compile everything available into a single research dossier: ownership, last sale, tax records, estimated value, comps, neighborhood demographics, schools, crime, flood zone, and a seller motivation score. Saves to cloud brain so deal-analyzer and investment-calculator can read this data without re-entering it.

## When This Skill Applies

- User provides a property address and wants to know everything about it
- User says "research this address" or "pull up property data"
- User wants pre-offer due diligence research
- User asks about property value, tax records, or sale history
- User needs comparable sales for an address
- User asks about neighborhood quality, schools, or crime
- User needs a property profile to present to a buyer or investor
- User wants flood zone, HOA, or zoning information
- User is preparing for a seller meeting and needs property intel

## How It Works

### Step 0: Parse the Address

Extract and standardize: street address, city, state, zip, county. If partial, use WebSearch to resolve the full address. If multiple matches, present options.

### Step 1: Property Details & Records

**Search queries:**
- `"{full address}" property records`
- `"{full address}" Zillow`
- `"{full address}" Redfin`
- `"{full address}" county assessor`
- `"{full address}" tax records`

**Capture:**

| Detail | Source |
|--------|--------|
| Property type | Assessor / Zillow |
| Bedrooms / Bathrooms | Listings / assessor |
| Square footage | Assessor |
| Lot size | Assessor |
| Year built | Assessor |
| Garage, pool, stories | Assessor / listing |
| Construction / roof type | Assessor |
| Zoning | County / city |
| Parcel / APN | Assessor |

### Step 2: Valuation & Sale History

**Search queries:**
- `"{full address}" sold price history`
- `"{full address}" Zestimate estimated value`
- `"{county} {state} recorder deeds {street address}"`

**Capture:**

| Date | Event | Price | Source |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| | Last sale | | |
| | Previous sale | | |
| | Tax assessed value | | |
| | Zillow Zestimate | | |
| | Redfin Estimate | | |

Calculate: annual appreciation rate from last sale, price/sqft vs. area average.

### Step 3: Tax Information

**Search:** `"{full address}" property tax amount`, `"{county} {state} property tax rate"`

Capture: annual tax, assessed value (land/improvement/total), effective rate, exemptions, delinquencies, special assessments.

### Step 4: Current / Recent Listings

**Search:** `"{full address}" for sale`, `"{full address}" listing history`

Capture: Is it listed? List price / DOM / price reductions. Previous listing attempts (expired/withdrawn = motivation signal). Listing agent and brokerage.

### Step 5: Neighborhood Analysis

**Search:** `"{zip code} neighborhood demographics"`, `"Niche.com {zip code}"`, `"AreaVibes {city} {state} {zip}"`

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Median household income | |
| Median home value | |
| Population growth trend | |
| Owner-occupied vs. renter % | |
| Walkability / livability score | |
| Cost of living index | |

### Step 6: School Ratings

**Search:** `"GreatSchools {city} {state} {zip code}"`, `"schools near {full address}"`

| School | Type | Rating | Distance |
|--------|------|--------|----------|
| | Elementary | /10 | |
| | Middle | /10 | |
| | High | /10 | |

### Step 7: Crime & Safety

**Search:** `"CrimeGrade {zip code}"`, `"crime rate {zip code} {year}"`

| Metric | Value | vs. National Avg |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Overall crime grade | | |
| Violent crime rate | | Above/Below |
| Property crime rate | | Above/Below |
| Crime trend | | |

### Step 8: Flood Zone & Environmental

**Search:** `"FEMA flood zone {full address}"`, `"{county} {state} flood zone map"`

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| FEMA flood zone | Zone X / A / AE / V |
| Flood insurance required | Yes/No |
| Estimated flood insurance cost | |
| Wildfire risk | Low/Med/High |
| Earthquake risk | Low/Med/High |

### Step 9: Comparable Sales

**Search:** `"recently sold homes near {full address}"`, `"Redfin sold {city} {state} {zip} {beds} bed"`

| # | Address | Beds/Ba | SqFt | Sale Price | $/SqFt | Sale Date | Distance |
|---|---------|---------|------|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | | | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | | | | |

Comp analysis: average sale price, average $/sqft, subject property estimated value, above/below market.

### Step 10: Seller Motivation Score

Score the seller's likely motivation 1–5 based on signals found in research:

| Signal | Weight | Finding |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Days since last sale (longer = more equity, possible fatigue) | | |
| Price reductions on current/prior listing | | |
| Multiple expired/withdrawn listings | | |
| Delinquent taxes | | |
| Code violations (if found) | | |
| Absentee owner (assessed address ≠ property address) | | |
| Estate / probate indicators | | |
| Long ownership with no refinance activity | | |

**Score:**
- 1–2: No obvious motivation — exploratory approach only
- 3: Moderate motivation — worth reaching out
- 4: Strong motivation — prioritize this property
- 5: High urgency — move quickly

### Step 11: Save to Cloud Brain

Save the complete dossier:

```
Path: brain/property-research/{address-slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md
Tool: mcp__cloud-brain__write_note
```

Tell the user: "Research saved. Run `rei-deal-analyzer` next to build a full go/no-go on this property using this data."
