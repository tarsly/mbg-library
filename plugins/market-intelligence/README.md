## First Run — Preferences Setup

On first use, each skill will ask you a few setup questions to personalize results:
- Your business name and what it does
- Your primary industry and markets
- Default research depth (Quick Brief / Standard / Deep Dive)
- Geography defaults for market sizing
- Known competitors to always include

Preferences are saved to your cloud brain and applied automatically on every future run. To update them, say: "Update my [skill] preferences."

## Two Skills That Work Together

**Market Research → SWOT Analysis**
Run market research first to size an opportunity, then run a SWOT to decide whether to pursue it. The SWOT skill automatically checks your cloud brain for prior research on the topic.

**Competitor Analysis → SWOT Analysis**
Run competitor analysis to map the landscape, then feed those findings into a SWOT for a strategic positioning decision.

**Person Research → [Any meeting]**
Run person research before any high-stakes meeting. Profiles are saved to your cloud brain under `brain/people/` and retrievable for future interactions with the same person.

## Output & Storage

All research is saved to your cloud brain:
- Deep Research → `brain/research/[topic-slug]`
- Market Research → `brain/research/[topic-slug]-market-research`
- Competitor Analysis → `brain/research/[market]-competitive-analysis`
- SWOT Analysis → `brain/research/swot-[topic-slug]-[date]`
- Person Profiles → `brain/people/person-[name-slug]`

Results are retrievable in future sessions — run a follow-on analysis and the skill will find your prior work automatically.
