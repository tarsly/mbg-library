## What This Plugin Does

Real Estate Agent Pro is a complete AI toolkit for real estate agents — from listing launch through closing, plus business development, lead nurturing, and production planning. Every skill saves your name, brokerage, and market details to memory on first use, so every subsequent output is pre-branded with zero setup.

Install once. Run it on your first real deal. Get a result that makes you look like a top producer.

## What's New in v1.2.0

- **11 new skills added** — listing presentations, expired/FSBO outreach, seller net sheets, offer writing and analysis, buyer lead nurture sequences, geographic farming, market reports, past client nurture, closing gifts and review requests, GCI production planning, and objection roleplay coaching
- **Preferences layer added to all 11 original skills** — every skill now searches memory for your saved details, confirms them, and runs a one-time setup interview if needed
- **Critical memory path fixes** — three original skills had hardcoded session paths that would fail on any client install; all replaced with proper Basic Memory MCP calls using standard `brain/` paths
- **Regulated disclaimers added** where required (CMA, creative finance, 1031 exchange, transaction coordination)
- **AGENTS.md** — a capabilities manifest for use with the agent designer (system-03) and agent activator (system-04)

## How Preferences Work

Every skill runs a one-time setup on first use:

1. Searches memory for `real-estate-agent-pro preferences`
2. If found → displays your saved details and confirms
3. If not found → runs a quick setup interview (name, brokerage, market, and any skill-specific defaults)
4. Saves to `brain/preferences/real-estate-agent-pro-preferences.md`
5. Shows a preferences banner on every output:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Agent: [Your Name] | [Brokerage] | Market: [Area]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

To update your preferences at any time, tell any skill: *"Update my preferences"* and it will re-run the setup interview.

## Memory Paths (Standard)

All data is saved to Basic Memory MCP under these paths:

| Data Type | Path |
|---|---|
| Agent preferences | `brain/preferences/real-estate-agent-pro-preferences.md` |
| Transactions | `brain/transactions/[address-slug].md` |
| 1031 exchanges | `brain/transactions/1031-[client-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md` |
| CMA outputs | `brain/deal-analyses/[address-slug]-cma-[YYYY-MM-DD].md` |
| Disclosures | `brain/disclosures/[address-slug].md` |
| Referral partners | `brain/referrals/referral-partners.md` |
| Buyer leads | `brain/leads/buyer-[name-slug].md` |
| Past clients | `brain/clients/[name-slug].md` |
| Geographic farms | `brain/projects/farm-[neighborhood-slug].md` |
| GCI tracker | `brain/projects/gci-tracker-[year].md` |
| Market reports | `brain/projects/market-report-[area-slug]-[YYYY-MM].md` |

---

## Two-Phase Design

Skills that involve high-stakes analysis follow a two-phase pattern:

- **Phase 1 (Screener/Builder)** — collects inputs, runs analysis, saves output to memory
- **Phase 2 (Advanced analysis)** — reads Phase 1 output from memory automatically, no re-entry required

Example: `cma-builder` saves the comp grid and value conclusion to `brain/deal-analyses/` → the listing presentation can reference it during the seller meeting.

## Using with the Agent System (system-03 / system-04)

This plugin includes `AGENTS.md` — a capabilities manifest that tells the agent designer (system-03) what this plugin can do, what preferences are needed, and how to suggest agent configurations for real estate clients.

**At system-03 (agent design):** If system-03 detects a real estate agent client, it can suggest org chart configurations — from a single all-in-one assistant to a full team of specialized agents.

**At system-04 (agent activation):** When activating a real estate agent, system-04 will run the preferences setup for the skills assigned to that agent. Preferences do not need to be set up separately — they are part of the activation flow.

See `AGENTS.md` in this plugin folder for the full capabilities reference, recommended schedules, and suggested agent configurations.

## Disclaimer

Skills in this plugin provide professional workflow tools for licensed real estate agents. They do not constitute legal advice, financial advice, or licensed appraisals. CMA outputs are pricing estimates, not USPAP-compliant valuations. Creative finance analysis is educational — always verify tax implications with a CPA and legal structure with a real estate attorney. 1031 exchange tracking is a deadline management tool — consult a Qualified Intermediary and tax professional for compliance decisions. Disclosure requirements vary by state — always verify with your broker and a licensed real estate attorney.
