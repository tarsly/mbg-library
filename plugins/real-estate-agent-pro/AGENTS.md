## About This Plugin

`real-estate-agent-pro` is a complete AI toolkit for licensed real estate agents. It covers every major workflow in a productive agent's business: listing and transaction management, buyer representation, lead generation and nurture, market analysis, business development, compliance, and coaching. Skills save preferences to shared memory so the agent's name, brokerage, market, and business details are pre-loaded across every interaction.

**Target users:** Solo agents, small teams, and buyer/listing agents at any production level. Especially valuable for agents looking to systematize their business, improve their listing-to-close conversion, and grow their referral pipeline.

**Plugin version:** 1.1.0 (18 skills at release; 5 added in v1.2.0)

## How system-03 Should Use This Document

When a client's brain context indicates they are a real estate agent (from system-02 business blueprint), system-03 should:

1. **Reference the Skills Catalog** to understand what capabilities are available — do not assume; check here.
2. **Surface capabilities based on what the client says they need** — not based on a fixed structure. If a client says "I need help staying in touch with past clients," point them to past-client-nurture, closing-gift-review-requester, and referral-partner-manager specifically.
3. **Present the skill catalog as a menu of capabilities** the client can assign freely to whatever agents they create — they are not locked into any configuration.
4. **Use the Suggested Configurations as conversation starters**, not defaults. Show Option A, B, C, or D and ask: "Does one of these match how you think about your business, or would you like to customize?"
5. **Check Natural Pairings** in each skill entry when designing multi-agent setups — these are the highest-value skill combinations.
6. **Note skills that share disclosure or compliance obligations** (transaction-coordinator + disclosure-compliance-tracker) — these are typically assigned together.

---

## How system-04 Should Use This Document

When activating an agent that has been assigned `real-estate-agent-pro` skills:

1. **Identify which skills are assigned to this agent** from the system-03 design output.
2. **Look up each assigned skill in the Skills Catalog** to get its "Preferences collected at activation" list.
3. **Take the union of all preference fields** across all assigned skills — this is the complete set to collect. Do not run a separate interview per skill.
4. **Cross-reference the Preferences Registry** to understand which fields are shared across many skills (Core Identity, Listing/Sales) versus skill-specific (1031 Exchange QI contact, closing gift budget). Collect shared fields once.
5. **Run one consolidated setup interview** — not one per skill. Group questions naturally: "Let's start with your basic info, then your business setup, then a few skill-specific questions."
6. **Write all preferences to one shared file:**
   ```
   brain/preferences/real-estate-agent-pro-preferences.md
   ```
   All skills in this plugin read from this single path. Writing to it once makes all skills work immediately.
7. **Reference the Recommended Schedules table** to suggest automated task cadences. Present the full schedule table to the client and ask: "Would you like any of these to run on a schedule, or would you prefer on-demand only?"
8. **Check if preferences already exist** before running the interview:
   ```
   mcp__cloud-brain__search_notes: "real-estate-agent-pro preferences"
   ```
   If found, confirm with the client and skip the interview — preferences carry across all agents in this plugin.
9. **After activation, confirm** which skills are live and what their schedules are. Give the client a one-line trigger phrase for each skill so they know how to use them.
