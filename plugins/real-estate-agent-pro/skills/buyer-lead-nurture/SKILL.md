## STEP 1: SELECT ACTION

**Ask the agent what they need:**

1. **Add a new lead** — capture info and generate their first outreach sequence
2. **Generate outreach for an existing lead** — pull from memory and generate next touch
3. **View the full buyer pipeline** — display all leads by segment with follow-up status
4. **Re-engage a quiet lead** — generate a re-engagement sequence
5. **Update a lead's status** — move a lead between segments or mark as closed/inactive

---

## STEP 2: LEAD INTAKE (for new leads)

If the agent is adding a new lead, collect the following. Mark optional items.

**Required:**
1. Lead's full name?
2. Phone number?
3. Email address?
4. How did you meet them / lead source? (open house / referral / online inquiry / past client / cold call / event)

**Qualifying Information:**
5. Pre-approval status? (Yes — approved / In process with lender / No — not started yet)
6. If pre-approved: approximate approval amount or budget range?
7. Target neighborhoods, areas, or school districts?
8. Timeline? (Ready now / 3 months / 6 months / 12+ months / Just exploring — no real timeline)
9. Current housing situation? (Renting month-to-month / Lease ends [date] / Owns — needs to sell first / Relocating / Living with family)
10. First-time buyer or has bought before?
11. Primary motivation — what's driving the move? (Growing family, job change, downsizing, lifestyle, investment, relocation)
12. Any known hesitations or obstacles? (Waiting for rates to drop, needs to sell first, saving for down payment)

**Save new lead to memory:**

## STEP 3: SEGMENT ASSIGNMENT

Based on timeline and pre-approval status, assign the lead to a segment. Show the assignment clearly and explain it to the agent.

---

**SEGMENT A — HOT** (Active, 0–90 days)
- Pre-approved or nearly there
- Actively searching; viewing listings; ready to make offers
- Timeline is now or within 3 months

*What they need:* New listings delivered fast, showing support, offer guidance, fast response times. This is an active client relationship, not a nurture sequence.

---

**SEGMENT B — WARM** (3–6 months out)
- Has clear motivation and a real timeline
- May need: time to get pre-approved, to sell current home, school year timing, lease end
- Engaged and responsive but not ready to view homes actively

*What they need:* Regular market education, occasional curated listings, pre-approval encouragement, milestone check-ins. Build trust now so they call you when they're ready to move.

---

**SEGMENT C — COOL** (6–12 months out)
- Clear motivation but timeline is genuinely not urgent
- Watching the market, not making moves yet
- Responsive when contacted but not initiating

*What they need:* Monthly low-pressure value adds, no asks, market context, occasional listings for awareness. Stay top of mind without being a pest.

---

**SEGMENT D — LONG-TERM** (12+ months or "just exploring")
- Early-stage, no real decision made
- May be inspired by curiosity, life event on the horizon, or general interest
- No timeline, may not be pre-qualified

*What they need:* Quarterly gentle touches. Educational content. Zero pressure. The goal is to still be their agent when the timeline crystallizes.

---

## STEP 4: NURTURE SEQUENCES

Generate the complete multi-touch sequence for the lead's segment. Auto-populate with agent name, brokerage, market, phone, email, and lead name from memory.

---

### SEGMENT A — HOT SEQUENCE

**Cadence:** Weekly minimum. Same-day response to any inquiry. Immediate listing alerts.

---

**Day 1 — Text (within hours of meeting):**
"Hey [Name]! [Agent Name] here — great meeting you at [source]. I'm adding your criteria to my search right now. You'll start getting listings as soon as something matches. Any questions in the meantime, just text me here."

**Day 1 — Email (same day):**

Subject: Your personalized home search is live — [Agent Name]

"Hi [Name],

It was great meeting you [today/recently]. I've set up your personalized search based on what you're looking for:

- Area(s): [target areas]
- Budget: up to $[X]
- Key criteria: [bedrooms, bathrooms, must-haves]

You'll get an email the moment something matching your criteria hits the market. I also watch for properties before they're officially listed — I'll reach out directly when I find something worth a look.

One thing that will help us move fast: [if not pre-approved] — getting your pre-approval locked in now means when the right home hits, we can move immediately. I can connect you with [lender name] if you'd like an introduction. [If pre-approved: You're in great shape with your pre-approval — we're ready to move the moment we find the right one.]

Looking forward to finding you something great.

[Agent Name]
[Phone] | [Email]"

---

**Day 3 — Email: First Curated Listings**

Subject: 3 homes I think you should see — [neighborhood]

"Hi [Name],

I've been keeping an eye on the market since we talked, and I've flagged a few that match your criteria:

[Listing 1]: [Address] — [beds/baths/price]. [1 sentence on why it fits their criteria — be specific.]

[Listing 2]: [Address] — [beds/baths/price]. [1 sentence on standout feature.]

[Listing 3]: [Address] — [beds/baths/price]. [1 sentence on value or opportunity.]

I can set up showings for any of these — including back-to-back if you want to see multiple in one trip. What does your schedule look like this weekend?

[Agent Name]"

---

**Day 7 — Call Script:**

"Hi [Name], [Agent Name] here. Just wanted to check in — did any of those listings I sent catch your eye? [Wait for response.]

[If yes]: Great — I can get us in to see it [day/time options]. Is [day] good for you?

[If no]: No problem. Tell me — what's missing? I want to refine the search so we're only looking at homes that actually fit. [Listen and take notes to update memory.]

One thing I want to flag: [any relevant market intel — e.g., 'inventory is really tight right now and homes are moving in under a week at this price point. When you see something you like, we'll want to move same-day if possible.']"

**Weekly from here:**
- New listing alerts as they hit (automated or manual)
- Brief text or email when something notable happens: price reduction on a home they showed interest in, similar home just sold above asking (market context), new listing in target area

---

### SEGMENT B — WARM SEQUENCE

**Cadence:** Every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly thereafter until timeline tightens.

---

**Week 1 — Email: Market Update**

Subject: What's happening in [market] real estate right now

"Hi [Name],

I wanted to keep you in the loop on what the [market] market is doing — especially since you're planning to buy in the next few months.

3 things worth knowing right now:

1. **Inventory:** There are currently [X] homes for sale in [target area]. That's [more/less/about the same] as 3 months ago — which means [implication for buyer: more choices / more competition / etc.]

2. **Prices:** Median sale price in [area] is currently $[X], [up/down/flat] vs. 6 months ago.

3. **Interest Rates:** Rates are currently around [X]% for a 30-year conventional. [1 sentence on what this means for their buying power — e.g., 'On a $400k purchase, that's a payment of approximately $X/month.']

Bottom line for you: [1–2 sentences on strategic recommendation given their timeline and situation.]

Questions? Happy to talk through it. And whenever you're ready to start viewing homes, just say the word.

[Agent Name]"

---

**Week 3 — Text: Curated Listing Mention**

"Hey [Name] — [Agent Name] here. Quick one: [address] just came on in [area they mentioned]. [One specific thing about why it fits: 'Has the big yard you mentioned' / 'Only one on the market under $X with 4 bedrooms in that school district']. I know you're still a few months out, but worth keeping on your radar. Want me to send you the details?"

---

**Week 5 — Email: Educational Content**

Pick the topic most relevant to their specific situation:

*For first-time buyers:*
Subject: What nobody told me about buying my first home (from a buyer's agent)

"Hi [Name], I work with a lot of first-time buyers, and the questions that come up most often are ones nobody thinks to ask until they're in the middle of the process. Here are 5 things I always cover early:

1. **Pre-approval vs. pre-qualification** — they are not the same, and only one carries weight with sellers.
2. **Earnest money** — what it is, where it goes, and when you can lose it.
3. **The inspection process** — what happens, what you can negotiate, and when to walk.
4. **Closing costs** — buyers pay 2–3% of the purchase price in addition to the down payment. Many first-time buyers are surprised by this.
5. **The timeline** — from accepted offer to close is typically 30–45 days. Here's what happens during that time.

Happy to go deeper on any of these — no pressure, just want you to feel prepared."

*For buyers waiting on rates:*
Subject: The rate question — should you wait?

"Hi [Name], I know you mentioned keeping an eye on where rates go before pulling the trigger. Fair. Here's the honest math worth considering:

[1-paragraph analysis of the rate-timing question: price appreciation vs. rate drops, refinancing later vs. buying now, opportunity cost of waiting. Keep it factual, not salesy.]

I'm not trying to push you into a decision. I just want you to have the full picture when you decide."

*For buyers who need to sell first:*
Subject: Your buying timeline and the sell-first question

"Hi [Name], I wanted to touch base on the sell-before-buy piece — it's one of the more complex parts of your situation and I want to make sure you're thinking about it early.

[Overview of bridge financing options, contingent offers and their challenges in the current market, timing considerations for listing their current home relative to buying.]

When you're ready to run through the full plan — sell timeline, what to expect in the process, and how to bridge the gap — I'm here. The earlier we map it out, the smoother it goes."

---

**Week 7 — Call Script:**

"Hi [Name], [Agent Name] here. Quick check-in — has your timeline changed at all? [Listen.]

[If timeline is tightening]: Great. Let's start thinking about getting your search more active. Have you connected with a lender yet? [If no: introduce lender.] And do you want to start doing a few showings just to calibrate — seeing a few homes in person really helps clarify what matters.

[If timeline is same]: No problem. I'll keep sending market updates. When you start feeling the urgency, just reach out — we can move fast."

---

**Monthly from Week 7+:**
One market update email + one listing when relevant. Light, helpful, no pressure.

---

### SEGMENT C — COOL SEQUENCE

**Cadence:** Monthly. No more frequent — these leads will tune out if contacted too often.

---

**Month 1 — Email: Neighborhood Spotlight**

Subject: What's selling in [target neighborhood] — [month, year]

"Hi [Name],

Thought you'd find this useful — here's a quick snapshot of what's happened in [target neighborhood] over the past 30 days:

- Homes sold: [X]
- Median close price: $[X]
- Average days on market: [X]
- Price trend vs. 6 months ago: [up/down/flat X%]

[1–2 sentence interpretation: 'Inventory remains tight, which means the homes that are priced well are still moving quickly. If you're planning to buy in this area, getting a pre-approval locked in before you're ready to view homes is a smart move.']

No action needed — just wanted to keep you informed. Talk soon.

[Agent Name]"

---

**Month 2 — Text: Light Touch**

"Hey [Name] — [Agent Name] here. Quick question: has your timeline shifted at all? I have something I think you'd genuinely love — but only want to send it over if the timing makes sense. No pressure either way."

*(If they respond positively: pivot to a Segment B approach and send the listing + a call.)*
*(If they say 'still a while out': "No worries — I'll keep an eye on things and check back in a month.")*

---

**Month 3 — Email: Buyer's Guide or Educational Content**

Subject: The [market] buyer's guide — what I wish every buyer read before starting

"Hi [Name],

I put together a short guide I share with buyers before they start the process — covers timeline, what to expect at each stage, and the questions most buyers don't think to ask until they're already in escrow.

[Link to buyer guide on website, OR offer to send as PDF, OR include 3–4 key points inline]

No ask — just useful information I want you to have before you need it. When the time gets closer, I'm here.

[Agent Name]"

---

**Quarterly from Month 3+:**
One brief call or email to re-qualify timeline and keep the relationship warm.

---

### SEGMENT D — LONG-TERM SEQUENCE

**Cadence:** Quarterly. The goal is to still be their agent in 12–18 months. Light. Helpful. Zero pressure.

---

**Q1 — Email: Annual Market Report**

Subject: [Market] real estate in [year] — what the data showed

"Hi [Name],

As we head into [new year / new quarter], I wanted to share a brief overview of what the [market] real estate market looked like over the past year — and what the data suggests for buyers planning ahead.

[3–5 bullet market summary: price trends, inventory trends, rate trends, buyer/seller balance, notable neighborhood shifts]

If you're still planning to buy at some point, this is the context worth having. Nothing actionable right now — just keeping you informed.

Happy to answer any questions whenever they come up.

[Agent Name]"

---

**Q2 — Email: Market Update + Personal Note**

Subject: Quick update + thinking of you

"Hi [Name],

I know it's been a few months — just wanted to check in and share a quick market note.

[2–3 sentences on current market conditions — what's happening with inventory, prices, rates]

I remember you mentioned [something from their intake — target area, motivation, timeline]. When that timeline starts to get closer, I'd love to be the first call you make. I'll keep an eye on things between now and then.

[Agent Name]"

---

**Q3 — Email: Neighborhood Spotlight**

Subject: What's happening in [area they mentioned]

"Hi [Name],

[Specific neighborhood] has seen some movement lately that I thought you'd find interesting:

[3 brief data points — recent sales, price per sq ft, DOM, any notable trends]

When you're ready to get serious about this area, we'll have a solid baseline to work from.

[Agent Name]"

---

**Q4 — Email: Year-End Re-Engagement**

Subject: Heading into [year] — still planning to buy?

"Hi [Name],

Hard to believe another year is almost up. I wanted to reach out directly: are you still planning to buy in [area] at some point?

No pressure either way — I just want to make sure I'm giving you the right level of attention. If your plans are still on track, I'd love to get a quick 10-minute call on the calendar to recalibrate. If life has taken things in a different direction, that's completely fine too — just let me know and I'll adjust my outreach accordingly.

Either way, thank you for staying in touch. I'm rooting for you.

[Agent Name]"

---

## STEP 5: RE-ENGAGEMENT (Leads Gone Quiet)

For any lead who has not responded to 2+ consecutive touches. Use before moving to long-term or marking inactive.

---

**Re-Engagement Text:**

"Hey [Name], no pressure at all — just want to make sure I haven't dropped the ball on my end. Still planning to buy in [area]? Happy to back off completely if timing has changed. Just want to make sure I'm being useful, not annoying."

*(If they don't respond to this within 7 days: send the email version.)*

---

**Re-Engagement Email:**

Subject: Quick check-in — [Name]

"Hi [Name],

I've reached out a couple times and want to make sure I'm not missing you or flooding your inbox at the wrong time.

If your buying plans are still on track — even if the timeline has shifted — I'd love to hear where things stand. A quick reply is all I need.

If circumstances have changed and you're no longer planning to buy, no hard feelings at all — just let me know and I'll stop the updates.

Either way, I hope things are going well.

[Agent Name]"

---

**If no response after 2 re-engagement attempts:**
Move to Segment D (Long-Term) quarterly sequence. Update memory to tag as "quiet."

---

## STEP 6: BUYER PIPELINE REPORT

On command ("show me my buyer pipeline" or "pipeline report"), pull all leads from memory and display:

```
