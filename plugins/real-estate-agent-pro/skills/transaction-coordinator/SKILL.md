  Transaction coordinator copilot — your safety net for every deal under contract.
  Missing a single contingency deadline can kill a deal, trigger earnest money
  forfeiture, or expose you to liability. Track every transaction from accepted
  offer to close: monitor critical deadlines with traffic-light urgency (RED if due
  in 3 days or fewer), track required documents, draft communications to lenders,
  title, and other agents, and generate pre-closing checklists. Reads and updates a
  brain file so you always know what is at risk across all open transactions.
  Use whenever you go under contract, need to check transaction status, are
  approaching a contingency deadline, or need to draft a nudge to your lender or
  title company. Triggers on: under contract, transaction, pending deal, contingency
  deadline, inspection deadline, closing date, TC, transaction coordinator,
  what is due, deal status, escrow, closing checklist.

# TRANSACTION COORDINATOR COPILOT

> **Disclaimer:** This skill is a professional workflow tool for real estate agents. It does not constitute legal advice. Contract deadlines, contingency requirements, and fiduciary obligations vary by state and contract type. Always verify critical dates against your actual contract documents and consult your broker or real estate attorney when in doubt. Never rely solely on this tool for compliance decisions.

Your real estate business lives or dies by deadlines. Miss an inspection contingency deadline and the buyer loses leverage — or worse, they claim you breached fiduciary duty. Miss a loan deadline and the deal collapses 3 days before close. **You need a system that screams at you when timelines are shrinking.**

This is that system.

## STEP 0: PREFERENCES

**If preferences are found:** Display them and confirm — "I found your saved preferences. Using: [Agent Name], [Brokerage], [defaults]. Proceed or update?"

**If no preferences found:** Run this setup interview:

> 1. Your full name (as it appears on your license)?
> 2. Brokerage name?
> 3. Your market / primary city?
> 4. Default inspection deadline (days from acceptance)? (Common: 7–10)
> 5. Default appraisal deadline (days from acceptance)? (Common: 17–21)
> 6. Default loan/financing deadline (days from acceptance)? (Common: 21)
> 7. Preferred lender partner name and contact (optional)?

## HOW IT WORKS

1. **New transaction:** "I just got an offer accepted on 123 Main St. Buyer is John Smith, closing in 45 days, inspection deadline is April 8." → I'll ask for missing critical dates, then save to `brain/transactions/123-main-st.md`.

2. **Check dashboard:** "Show me my transaction status" → Full board with all deadlines ranked by urgency.

3. **Deadline alerts:** "What's due this week?" → All RED and YELLOW items with suggested next steps.

4. **Draft communications:** "Draft a lender follow-up for 123 Main St" → Professional email ready to send.

5. **Pre-closing prep:** "Run the pre-closing checklist for 123 Main St" → 7-day countdown checklist.

6. **Update progress:** "We got the appraisal for 123 Main St" → Updates the memory file and refreshes dashboard.

---

**Bottom line:** Real estate runs on deadlines. Miss them and deals die — along with your commissions and your reputation. Update this tool. Check it every morning. It's the difference between closing on time and managing crisis mode.
