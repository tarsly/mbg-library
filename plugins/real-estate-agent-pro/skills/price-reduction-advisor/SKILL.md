  Help a top real estate listing agent decide exactly when and how much to reduce
  a listing price — then prepare a complete, data-backed seller conversation package
  including a reduction script, talking points, objection handlers, and a visual
  one-pager. Use this skill whenever a listing is stale, DOM is too high, there are
  no offers, showing activity has dropped, or you need to have a price conversation
  with a seller. Triggers on: price reduction, price drop, cut the price, listing not
  selling, DOM too high, no offers, stale listing, reduce price, seller conversation
  about price, pricing strategy, overpriced listing.

Help your sellers make the RIGHT decision on price with data, not emotion. This skill walks you through analysis in minutes and gives you everything you need for a confident, empathetic seller conversation.

## STEP 1: Gather the Situation

Ask for (or parse from what you tell me):

**Core Numbers:**
- Current list price
- Days on market (DOM)
- Total showings to date
- Showings per week (recent trend)
- Offers received (count and status)

**Market Data:**
- Recent comparable sales in the area (3-5 sales, last 30-60 days)
- Original list price (if it's been reduced before)
- Seller's timeline / financial motivation

**Feedback Themes:**
- What are showing agents hearing? ("Too high for the neighborhood," "Beautiful but priced $30k over," etc.)
- Any specific feedback about condition, location, or comparables?

You don't need all of this. Give me what you have, and I'll ask for what matters.

## STEP 2: Run the Decision Engine

I'll analyze using these five benchmarks:

### 1. Days On Market (DOM) Signal
- **Benchmark:** [Use market benchmark from preferences — default 21 days] with no offers + showing activity dropping = pricing problem
- **Why it matters:** The market speaks fast. If serious buyers have seen it and passed, they're telling you the price.
- **Action:** If DOM > [benchmark] with <3 showings/week, price review is urgent.

### 2. Showing-to-Offer Ratio
- **Benchmark:** [Use market ratio from preferences — default: 10+ showings, zero offers = likely 5-10% overpriced]
- **Why it matters:** Plenty of interest but no offers means buyers like it but won't bite at this price.
- **Action:** This is the clearest signal. 15+ showings, no offers? Price cut is coming.

### 3. Price Band Analysis
- **Benchmark:** Is it sitting just above a psychological search threshold?
- **Examples:** $505k when most searches stop at $500k; $2.95M when buyers filter at $2.9M
- **Why it matters:** Buyers anchor to round numbers. Being $15k above a threshold can cost you 30% of your traffic.
- **Action:** I'll identify if you're just above a band and recommend crossing below it.

### 4. Comp Drift
- **Benchmark:** Have recent closed sales come in 3-5% lower than when you priced this?
- **Why it matters:** Market moves fast. Last month's comp-based price may already be yesterday's number.
- **Action:** If 3+ recent sales are lower, your price already aged.

### 5. Absorption Rate
- **Benchmark:** How many competing homes went under contract this week in your neighborhood?
- **Why it matters:** If 5+ homes sold and yours sits, you're being rejected by a hot market.
- **Action:** In an active market, being on the market long is a major red flag.

## STEP 3: Give You a Recommendation

I will provide:

1. **Specific price reduction** (dollar amount AND percentage)
   - Example: "Reduce from $575k to $549k (-4.5%)"

2. **Plain English reasoning**
   - "You've had 14 showings in 2 weeks with zero offers. Feedback says 'priced $20-25k high.' Recent comps average $550k. The market is saying $549-552k."

3. **New price band**
   - "This lands you in the $549k band, below the $550k search threshold, which could add 20-30% showing traffic."

4. **Expected impact projection**
   - "At $549k, you should see showing activity jump to 4-5 per week. Anticipate an offer within 7-10 days."

## STEP 4: Generate the Seller Conversation Package

### A. Price Reduction Script
Data-backed, empathetic, NOT defensive. Auto-signed with agent name from preferences.

I'll give you exact language that:
- Acknowledges their emotional investment
- Explains what the market is actually saying (feedback + numbers)
- Positions the reduction as a STRATEGY, not a failure
- Moves to action without over-explaining

**Example tone:** "Here's what I'm seeing: We've had 14 qualified buyers through. They love the home. But feedback is consistent — they're seeing it as $20-25k above where it needs to be. That tells me we have a pricing opportunity, not a property problem."

### B. Key Talking Points
- What the showing agents are saying (the market's voice)
- Recent comp data (not your opinion, the data)
- DOM comparison to neighborhood average
- Showing-to-offer ratio (hard signal)
- Impact of crossing a price band threshold
- Timeline: How quickly you expect to see movement

### C. Objection Handlers
Pre-loaded responses for the five things sellers always say:

1. **"But Zillow says it's worth $600k"**
   - Zillow is backward-looking. Your recent comps are here-and-now. We use actual closed sales, not Zestimate.

2. **"I need to get $575k to break even on my mortgage"**
   - I understand. Let's run the math: What's your timeline? How much longer can you carry the home? [Calculate carrying costs vs. price reduction]. Usually the faster sale saves money.

3. **"Let's just wait. The market will come to us."**
   - We could wait, but here's the risk: Every week, this home ages. Showing traffic drops. We lose momentum. We're fighting that now at $575k. [Show DOM trend line.]

4. **"I'll reduce $5k and see what happens"**
   - A $5k cut on a $575k home is .8%. That's not enough to reset buyer perception or cross a price band. I recommend hitting $549k to get real traction. Here's why: [Show feedback summary + comp clustering.]

5. **"I want to price it high and take what I can get."**
   - That strategy works in seller's markets, but we're in [market condition]. Right now, price discipline = faster sales + fewer days on market + stronger offers. High price + long DOM signals distress.

### D. One-Page Visual Summary
A clean, text-based visual the seller can take home. Includes:

**Price Reduction Summary**
- Current: $575k | DOM: 32 | Showings: 14 | Offers: 0
- Recommended: $549k (-$26k, -4.5%)
- Comp range: $548–555k
- Benchmark: 21 DOM before price review / Your market: 32 DOM

**Why This Price Works**
- ✓ Aligns with recent sales
- ✓ Crosses below $550k threshold (adds search visibility)
- ✓ Matches showing feedback ($20–25k high)
- ✓ Competes with 3 new actives in your price band

**What to Expect**
- Showing activity: 4–5 per week (up from 2–3)
- Timeline to offer: 7–10 days
- Offer quality: Full-price or near-full offers likely

## How to Use This Skill

**Tell me what you've got:**
- "My listing in Hillside is at $575k, 32 days, 14 showings, no offers. Feedback says it's overpriced. Comp sales from last month are averaging $550k."

OR

- "Price check on 42 Oak Street. It's been sitting 3 weeks, showing twice last week, very few calls. What should I do?"

**I'll immediately:**
1. Run the five benchmarks
2. Give you a specific price reduction + reasoning
3. Generate the full seller conversation package (script, talking points, objections, visual)
4. You'll have everything in under 5 minutes

**Use the output to:**
- Walk into the seller conversation fully prepared
- Show the seller the data (not your gut feeling)
- Handle pushback with tested language
- Move the listing fast with confidence

---

## Why This Works

Top agents know: **The first price is the most important decision.** But when the first price was wrong, the second decision is speed. Every day a home sits unsold, it ages in the market. Buyer perception shifts. Competition increases.

This skill turns a tough seller conversation into a data-backed strategy session. You're not asking them to accept a loss. You're showing them the path to the fastest sale at the best price the market will bear right now.

**Urgency:** Use this skill the moment DOM exceeds your market's benchmark or showing activity stalls. Don't wait for the 4th or 5th week of no offers.
