You're taking a new listing. This skill generates your complete listing launch package — a professional workflow from signed agreement to live on MLS. Every detail covered, nothing slips.

## Step 1: Gather Listing Details

Collect the following information about the property. If you're providing property details directly, I'll parse them. Otherwise, I'll ask clarifying questions:

**Property Basics:**
- Full property address
- List price
- Target go-live date (when should it hit MLS?)
- Property type (single family, condo, townhome, land)

**Seller Information:**
- Seller name(s)
- Seller's timeline / motivation
- Any red flags or challenges

**Property Features:**
- Bedrooms / bathrooms
- Square footage
- Garage (0/1/2/3+, type)
- Lot size
- Year built
- Recent updates / renovations
- Unique selling points (views, location, pool, etc.)
- Concerns to address in marketing

Provide as much or as little detail as you have. I'll generate your full package from whatever you give me.

## Step 2: Your Complete Listing Launch Package

I'll generate all of the following, customized to your property:

### 1. PHOTOGRAPHY BRIEF
A detailed shot list for the photographer covering:
- Must-have exterior angles and details (front, back, sides, landscaping)
- Interior priority rooms (master, kitchen, main living areas)
- Detail shots (high-end finishes, fixtures, built-ins)
- Drone / twilight recommendations (if applicable)
- Staging notes to communicate to seller before shoot day
- Timeline and next steps

### 2. STAGING CHECKLIST
Room-by-room prep list for the seller:
- What to declutter in each space
- Deep cleaning priorities
- Furniture arrangement tips
- Curb appeal quick wins
- Major "don't do" list (no air fresheners, remove personal photos, pet odors, clutter, etc.)
- Timeline to complete before photography

### 3. MLS INPUT SHEET
Pre-filled template with all required MLS fields (auto-populated with agent name and brokerage from preferences):
- Compelling property description (250+ words)
- Feature checkboxes (fireplace, hardwood, appliances, etc.)

- Disclosures checklist
- Open house dates (if applicable)
- Copy-paste ready for your MLS portal

### 4. PRE-LAUNCH TIMELINE

- **T-14 days:** Sign listing agreement, order photography, schedule pre-inspection
- **T-10 days:** Photography shoot, gather disclosure documents
- **T-7 days:** Staging walkthrough with seller, final prep
- **T-5 days:** Review photos, write MLS description, prep marketing materials
- **T-3 days:** Load to MLS as "Coming Soon," send to buyer agent network

- **T-0:** Go live, post to social media, send to sphere

### 5. SHOWING INSTRUCTIONS DRAFT
Ready for your MLS showing instructions (auto-populated with agent name from preferences):
- Access type (lockbox, agent showing, keypad, etc.)
- Notice required (24/48/72 hours)
- Pet and alarm instructions
- Seller preferences (times to avoid, no showing stickers, etc.)

- Cancellation policy

### 6. DISCLOSURE TRACKER
Standard residential disclosures with status checkboxes:
