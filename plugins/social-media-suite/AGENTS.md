**Agent name:** Social Media Manager (or a persona name the client chooses)

**All 13 skills assigned to this agent.**

**Activation interview:** Full preferences registry (via sm-onboard). Takes 30–45 minutes once.

### Option B: Content Creator + Social Media Manager (Two-Agent Setup)

Two agents with clear division of responsibility. Best for clients who are active on 4+ platforms, publish daily, have a YouTube channel as a primary platform, or work with a small team where content creation and publishing are separate functions.

**Agent 1: Content Creator**

Responsibilities: research, ideation, writing, and visual direction.

Skills: sm-trend-watcher, sm-content-creator, sm-visual-creator, sm-competitor-watch, sm-repurpose

Weekly tasks:
- Monday: sm-trend-watcher + sm-competitor-watch
- Tuesday–Wednesday: sm-content-creator + sm-visual-creator

**Agent 2: Social Media Manager**

Responsibilities: strategy, scheduling, analytics, and client relationship.

Skills: sm-onboard, sm-tool-setup, sm-discovery, sm-brand-snapshot, sm-strategy-builder, sm-content-calendar, sm-schedule-queue, sm-analytics-review

Weekly tasks:
- Thursday: sm-schedule-queue

Monthly tasks:
- 1st: sm-analytics-review + sm-content-calendar

**Handoff:** Content Creator saves drafts to Cloud Brain → Social Media Manager reads them in sm-schedule-queue for approval and scheduling.

## How system-03 Should Use This Document

1. **Read the Skills Catalog** to understand capabilities before proposing agent configurations.
2. **Present Option A as the default** for solo entrepreneurs and clients on 1–3 platforms. Present Option B when the client mentions YouTube as a primary channel plus 3+ other platforms, or when they have team support for content production.
3. **Use the Suggested Configurations as conversation starters** — clients are free to customize freely.
4. **Note that sm-onboard coordinates discovery, brand, and strategy** — system-04 does not need to run these separately; sm-onboard handles it.
5. **Flag the Metricool connection as a requirement** for scheduling features. If the client hasn't connected Metricool, sm-tool-setup guides them through it.

---

## How system-04 Should Use This Document

1. **When activating the Social Media Manager agent:** Check Cloud Brain first — `search_notes` with query `"social media suite preferences"`. If sm-onboard has already been run, preferences are complete and activation is just a confirmation + schedule setup. If not, run sm-onboard now.
2. **Do not run a separate preferences interview** — sm-onboard conducts it. system-04's role here is to confirm preferences, set up scheduled tasks, and update agent status.
3. **Use the Recommended Schedules table** to present the weekly and monthly task schedule. Confirm days/times with the client.
4. **For Option B (two-agent):** Activate Content Creator first (skill subset sm-trend-watcher, sm-content-creator, sm-visual-creator, sm-competitor-watch, sm-repurpose). Then activate Social Media Manager (remaining skills). Both agents read from and write to the same Cloud Brain paths.
5. **Write all preferences to:**
   ```
   brain/preferences/social-media-suite-preferences.md
   ```
6. **After activation, confirm the trust level** — whether the client wants full approval mode (all posts reviewed) or if any content types are already set to auto-schedule.
