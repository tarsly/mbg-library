## What This Plugin Does

EOS Operator runs your business on the **Entrepreneurial Operating System** — the framework Gino Wickman lays out in *Traction*. Thirteen skills cover the full EOS toolkit: V/TO, Accountability Chart, Rocks, Scorecard, Issues, IDS, To-Dos, Level 10 Meetings, Quarterly Pulsing, Annual Planning, People Analyzer, Core Process documentation, and the EOS Organizational Checkup. Every skill reads from and writes to your Cloud Brain so every meeting builds on the last — no spreadsheets, no Notion sprawl, no losing your numbers between quarters.

## The EOS Cadence

| Rhythm | Skill(s) | Cadence |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Daily | (no skill — use a stand-up huddle) | 5-15 min daily |
| Weekly | `eos-level10` → `eos-scorecard` → `eos-rocks` → `eos-issues` → `eos-ids` → `eos-todos` | 90 min weekly |
| Quarterly | `eos-quarterly-pulsing` → `eos-rocks` → `eos-vto-builder` (Traction side) | 1 day quarterly |
| Annually | `eos-annual-planning` → `eos-vto-builder` (full refresh) → `eos-process-docs` review | 2 days annually |
| As needed | `eos-accountability-chart`, `eos-people-analyzer`, `eos-process-docs`, `eos-health-check` | Quarterly+ |

---

## The Three Numbers EOS Companies Watch

| Number | Target | Surfaced in |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Rock completion rate per quarter | **≥80%** | `eos-rocks`, `eos-quarterly-pulsing` |
| To-Do completion rate per L10 | **≥90%** | `eos-todos`, `eos-level10` |
| L10 meeting rating (1-10) | **≥8 average** | `eos-level10` |

Plus the **EOS Organizational Checkup** score from `eos-health-check` (target: 80%+ = "Strong on EOS").

---

## Cloud Brain Integration

Every EOS skill stores state in your Cloud Brain (folder: `eos`). Skills cross-read each other on every invocation — so when you run `/eos-level10`, the meeting agenda already has your live scorecard numbers, current rock status, last week's to-dos, and the issues list ready to IDS.

Skills also read your existing onboarding context if you've gone through the system 01 Goal Architect — `business blueprint`, `goal-hierarchy`, `quarterly-priorities`, and `language-and-frameworks` notes are auto-loaded so you don't re-enter your company name, industry, or current commitments.

---

## Dashboard Publishing

Most report-shaped skills (L10, Scorecard, Rocks, Quarterly, Annual, V/TO, Org Chart, Health Check) support `--publish` to push a card to your `mybusinessgenie.ai` cloud dashboard. The visualization uses progress bars, sparklines, trend arrows, and status badges to make the EOS health of your business readable at a glance.

People Analyzer, Issues, and IDS outputs do **not** auto-publish — they often contain sensitive leadership content. Opt-in only.

---

## Seats ↔ AI Agents

`eos-accountability-chart` lets you tag each seat as `human`, `ai`, `mixed`, or `open`. When you have open or AI-eligible seats, the skill hands them off to `/agent-designer` (from the **AI Agents** plugin) pre-loaded — so your EOS org chart and your AI agent team stay in sync without double-entry.
