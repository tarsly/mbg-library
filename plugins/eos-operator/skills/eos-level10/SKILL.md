# EOS Level 10 Meeting — The 90-Minute Heartbeat

## Overview

The Level 10 (L10) is EOS's core weekly meeting. 90 minutes, same day/time every week, one L10 per team (leadership L10, sales L10, etc.). The agenda is fixed — Segue (5), Scorecard (5), Rock Review (5), Customer/Employee Headlines (5), To-Do List Review (5), IDS (60), Conclude (5). The goal is consistently rating it 8+ out of 10. This skill walks the team through every segment with a running timer, pulls live data from `eos-scorecard` / `eos-rocks` / `eos-todos` / `eos-issues`, drives `eos-ids` for each top-3 issue, and writes the full meeting minutes plus the cascading message.

## When This Skill Applies

- User says "run L10", "start L10", "weekly meeting", "prep my L10", "L10 notes"
- It's the L10 day/time per `eos-company-preferences`
- The meeting is mid-flight and user wants to capture an item
- After the meeting — user wants the cascading message drafted
- User invokes `/eos-level10`

## Pre-Flight — Onboarding + Preferences

In parallel:

1. `search_notes "business blueprint"`, `"eos company preferences"`
2. `search_notes "EOS Scorecard"`
3. `search_notes "EOS Rocks — {current quarter}"`
4. `search_notes "EOS To-Dos"`
5. `search_notes "EOS Issues List"`
6. `search_notes "EOS L10"` then most-recent — for last week's recap

```

## How It Works

### Step 0: Determine Action

Parse to: `prep`, `run`, `capture`, `recap`. Default: `prep` if before meeting day/time; `run` if at/just after.

### Step 1: Prep — Pre-Meeting Digest

Before the meeting, generate a one-page brief:

- **Scorecard summary** — # on-goal, # off-goal, mini-trend per measurable
- **Rock status** — count by status, off-track Rocks named
- **To-Do completion** — last week's % complete
- **Top 3 Issues** — for IDS
- **Headlines** — none yet; live during meeting

Output as `L10 PRE-MEETING DIGEST` block. The Integrator reads this before the meeting.

### Step 2: Run — Live Meeting Mode

Walk the team through each segment with a timer. Capture inline.

#### Segment 1: Segue (5 min)
Prompt each attendee one at a time: *"{Name} — one personal best and one professional best from the past week. 30 seconds."*

Capture the lines.

#### Segment 2: Scorecard (5 min)
Read `EOS Scorecard`. For each off-goal measurable, prompt the owner: *"{Owner}, {Measurable} was off goal — drop in Issues for IDS, or known and recovering?"*

Off-goal items the owner can't recover same-week → add to `EOS Issues List` Short-Term with source `scorecard`.

#### Segment 3: Rock Review (5 min)
Read `EOS Rocks — {quarter}`. For each Rock owner, prompt: *"{Owner}, Rock '{title}' — On Track or Off Track?"*

Update `eos-rocks` status. Off Track items with 3+ weeks off → flag for Issues per `eos-rocks` rules.

#### Segment 4: Customer/Employee Headlines (5 min)
*"Anyone have a customer or employee headline — good or bad — worth a 30-second share?"*

Capture each headline. Any action items → To-Dos. Any unresolved issues → Issues List.

#### Segment 5: To-Do List Review (5 min)
Call `eos-todos recap`. For each open to-do from last week, mark Done or Not Done. Compute % complete vs 90% target.

#### Segment 6: IDS (60 min)
Pull top-3 Issues from `eos-issues`. For each (allocating ~20 min — but use time-box, often <10 min each):

- Call `eos-ids` for that issue
- Capture root cause, discussion, solve (to-do/rock/decision)
- Close the issue

If team blows through top-3 in <60 min, work the next-ranked issues until time-box hits.

#### Segment 7: Conclude (5 min)
Three steps:
1. **Recap to-dos** — read each new to-do back with owner + due date
2. **Cascading message** — draft 2-3 sentences: *"What does the rest of the company need to know from this meeting?"*
3. **Rate the meeting** — each attendee: 1-10. Compute average vs 8/10 target.

If average <8, capture as an Issue for next L10.

### Step 3: Save — Meeting Minutes

`mcp__cloud-brain__write_note`:
- **title:** `EOS L10 — {YYYY-MM-DD}` (or `EOS L10 — {Team} — {YYYY-MM-DD}` if multiple teams)
- **folder:** `eos`
- **tags:** `["eos","l10","meeting"]`

Use the Data Structure template.

### Step 4: Publish (optional)

On `--publish`:
- `taskName: "eos-l10-recap"`
- `category: "briefing"`
- `content`: the rendered one-pager
- `summary`: *"L10 {date}: rating {N}/10 · scorecard {hit}/{total} · rocks {ot}/{total} on track · todos {done}% · {N} issues IDS'd · {N} new todos."*

### Step 5: Capture Mode

When the user calls `capture` mid-meeting, append the captured item to the appropriate section of the in-progress L10 note. Recognize: "to-do — …", "issue — …", "headline — …", "decision — …".

## Data Structure

`EOS L10 — {YYYY-MM-DD}` note:

```markdown
# EOS L10 — {Date} — {Team}

> **Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
> **Duration:** 90 minutes (target)
> **Attendees:** {names}
> **Meeting Rating:** {avg}/10 · Individual: {name1: N1, name2: N2, ...}

CASCADING MESSAGE (draft):
  "We IDS'd the slowdown in demos this week — root cause was unstaffed RFP work,
  not a pipeline problem. We're hiring a Sales Engineer (new Q3 Rock) and Mark is
  personally taking the second active RFP this week."

MEETING RATING: 8.6 / 10  ✅  (target ≥8.0)

## Example Usage

**User:** "Prep my L10."
**AI:** Reads all sources. Renders pre-meeting digest.

**User:** "Run L10."
**AI:** Walks all 7 segments with per-segment timer, capturing inline.

**User (mid-meeting):** "Capture — Sarah committed to call Bob about renewal by Friday."
**AI:** Appends to the in-progress L10 note's To-Dos section.

**User (mid-meeting):** "Next issue — demos booked off 4 weeks."
**AI:** Hands off to `eos-ids` for that issue. Returns with the solve. Records.

**User:** "/eos-level10 run --publish"
**AI:** Runs the meeting then publishes the recap.

**User:** "What was last week's rating?"
**AI:** Reads most-recent `EOS L10` note. Returns the rating + drivers.

## Error Handling

- **Pre-meeting data missing (no Scorecard yet, no Rocks set):** Run the meeting anyway. Surface the gap: *"No scorecard set up yet — run /eos-scorecard before next L10 to get the pulse working."*
- **Attendees list empty in prefs:** Ask: *"Who's at this L10? Just for capture."*
- **Time-box hit during IDS top-3:** Warn but keep going on current issue. Cut the next one short if needed. Capture untouched issues as "carry-over" in the minutes.
- **Average rating <8:** Add to Issues List for next week's IDS: *"Meeting rated {N}. EOS target is 8. What would make next week's L10 a 10?"*
- **No top-3 prioritized in Issues:** Call `eos-issues prioritize` inline before IDS segment.
- **User wants to skip a segment:** Allow but log it. Skipping >2 weeks = surface as a discipline issue.
- **Note collision (two L10s same date):** Append team slug: `EOS L10 — Leadership — 2026-09-08` vs `EOS L10 — Sales — 2026-09-08`.
- **Dashboard publish requested but `mcp__cloud-dashboard__publish_report` fails:** Save minutes successfully. Warn about publish failure. Don't lose data.
