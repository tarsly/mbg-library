# IDS — Identify, Discuss, Solve

## Overview

IDS is EOS's single most-used tool inside an L10: walk an issue from headline → root cause → permanent solve. Most teams discuss symptoms forever and "solve" with no owner. This skill prevents that. Three phases, in order: **Identify** (peel layers until you hit root cause), **Discuss** (open, candid, everyone speaks once before anyone speaks twice — no solutioning yet), **Solve** (concrete next action: To-Do, Rock, decision, or escalation, with exactly one owner).

## When This Skill Applies

- User says "IDS this", "let's solve this", "drill into this", "work this issue"
- User says "we have an issue with [X]" — automatically enters Identify
- `eos-level10` calls during the 60-minute IDS segment for each top-3 issue
- User invokes `/eos-ids`

## Pre-Flight — Onboarding + Preferences

In parallel:

1. `search_notes "business blueprint"`, `"eos company preferences"`
2. `search_notes "EOS Issues List"` — to pick which issue to work
3. `search_notes "EOS V/TO"` — to check Core Values for tie-ins (if the issue is people-related)

```

## How It Works

### Step 0: Pick the Issue

If invoked with `--issue` text or `--from-list <issue-id>`, use it. Otherwise:
- If `EOS Issues List` exists, show top-3 and ask which to work
- If no list, ask: *"What's the issue? One sentence."*

### Step 1: IDENTIFY — Get to the Root Cause

Phase goal: separate the headline from the real issue. The headline is rarely the real problem.

Ask up to 3 layered questions, one at a time, in TARS-tight language:
1. *"What's actually happening? Be specific."*
2. *"What's underneath that? Why is this happening?"*
3. *"And what's underneath THAT? What's the real root cause?"*

Continue until the team agrees on the root cause. Stop when:
- The team says "that's it" or "now we're at the root"
- 3 questions deep with no new layer surfaces — pause, ask: *"Are we at the root, or are we avoiding something?"*

Capture the root cause one-line.

**Common patterns to surface:**
- Headline: "Sales are down" → Root: "Lost our biggest rep, haven't replaced"
- Headline: "Team is burned out" → Root: "Sales committed to delivery dates Ops never agreed to"
- Headline: "Customer complaints up" → Root: "Onboarding skipped Step 4 since the SOP change"

### Step 2: DISCUSS — Open and Candid

Phase goal: every voice heard, no solutioning yet.

Rules to enforce:
- *"Everyone speaks once before anyone speaks twice."*
- *"No 'yes-buts' — just say what you see."*
- *"No solutions yet. Just discuss the root."*

For an interactive facilitation, prompt each attendee by name (from prefs leadership roster). Capture each comment.

When all voices heard OR the time-box (default 7-10 min per issue) is hit, move to Solve.

### Step 3: SOLVE — Concrete, with One Owner

Phase goal: a single, specific action that permanently kills the issue.

Ask: *"What's the solve? It needs to be one of:*
- *A 7-day To-Do (action item)*
- *A 90-day Rock (significant initiative)*
- *A decision (clear yes/no/policy)*
- *An escalation (Visionary / board / external)*

*Whatever it is, ONE owner."*

Validate:
- Concrete (verb-led, specific, measurable)
- Single owner (named person, not a department)
- Has a due date (7 days for To-Do, 90 for Rock, immediate for decision)

If the solve is fuzzy ("we should improve the handoff"), refuse: *"That's not a solve, that's a wish. What action makes that real, by when, and who owns it?"*

### Step 4: Write Through

On Solve, spawn the right downstream note:
- **To-Do:** Call `eos-todos` add semantics — write/edit `EOS To-Dos` note
- **Rock:** Call `eos-rocks` add semantics — create a new Rock note (validate SMART first)
- **Decision:** Log in the meeting minutes (the L10 or quarterly note) under Decisions
- **Escalation:** Add to long-term issues list with `[ESCALATED]` tag

Close the source issue in `EOS Issues List`:
- Mark as closed
- Record resolution type + owner + outcome
- Move to `## Closed` section

### Step 5: Confirm and Move On

Output a 3-line recap:
```
✅ Solved: {issue}
   Root cause: {one-line}
   Action: {to-do / rock / decision} — {owner} — by {date}
```

For L10 use, hand control back to `eos-level10` to pick the next issue.

## Data Structure

IDS does not save its own note — it writes through to `EOS To-Dos`, `EOS Rocks`, or the active meeting minutes note. It does update `EOS Issues List` to close the source issue with the resolution recorded.

Optional: if invoked outside an L10 (standalone), write an `EOS IDS — {YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM} — {short-slug}` note in the `eos` folder, tagged `["eos","ids","standalone"]`, containing the full Identify/Discuss/Solve transcript.

## Output Format

```
🔧 EOS IDS | Issue: Demos booked off 4 weeks straight

─── IDENTIFY ───
Q: What's actually happening?
   "Sarah's demo count dropped from 8/wk to 4/wk starting late June."

Q: What's underneath that?
   "She's been pulled into RFP responses for two big enterprise deals."

Q: And underneath THAT?
   "We never staffed RFP work — it falls on Sarah by default. ← ROOT"

─── DISCUSS ───
  Mark: "Agreed — we said we'd hire a sales engineer in Q2. Slipped."
  Jen:  "RFPs eat 8-10 hours each. Two RFPs = a full week of Sarah."
  Sarah: "I can't do both. Need a decision."

─── SOLVE ───
  Action: Hire a Sales Engineer by 9/30/26 → NEW ROCK (Mark owns)
  Stopgap: RFP #2 handed to Mark personally → TO-DO (Mark, due Friday)

  ✅ Solved.
     Issue: Demos booked off 4 weeks
     Root cause: No RFP staffing — falls to Sarah by default
     Actions:
       • Rock: Sales Engineer hired by 9/30 — Mark
       • To-Do: Mark takes RFP #2 by Friday — Mark
```

## Example Usage

**User:** "IDS this: our team is burned out."
**AI:** Walks Identify (3 layers) → finds root ("Sales commits dates Ops never agrees to"). Discusses. Solves with a To-Do for a weekly Sales/Ops sync + a decision (Ops has veto on delivery dates).

**User:** "/eos-ids --from-list 1"
**AI:** Reads top-1 issue from `EOS Issues List`. Walks IDS. Writes through. Closes the issue.

**User:** "We have an issue with customer complaints."
**AI:** Auto-enters Identify mode. Drives to root. Discusses. Solves.

**User (from inside an L10):** "Next issue. Demos off 4 weeks."
**AI (as part of /eos-level10):** Runs the IDS skill in time-boxed mode. Returns to L10 when done.

**User:** "The solve is 'improve communication.'"
**AI:** Refuses: *"That's not a solve. Concrete action, single owner, due date. What's the actual next step?"*

## Error Handling

- **Identify stalls (5+ "I don't know"):** Pause: *"Sounds like we don't have enough information. Want to make 'gather data on X' a To-Do and IDS this next week?"*
- **Discuss spirals (>10 min, no new info):** Time-box hit. Force-move to Solve: *"We're past the time-box. What's the best solve we can name with what we know?"*
- **Solve is fuzzy:** Reject. Re-ask. Do NOT save until concrete.
- **Solve has no owner or 'we' as owner:** Refuse: *"'We' isn't an owner. Who specifically?"*
- **Two people insist on different root causes:** Capture both. *"You disagree on the root. Best path: name the loudest constraint first, solve that, see if the other resolves. Pick one."*
- **Issue is actually 3 issues:** Surface: *"This looks like 3 issues — A, B, C. Want to IDS them one at a time?"* Split and queue.
- **Source issue not found in Issues List:** Allow standalone IDS. Save the transcript to `EOS IDS — …` and offer to add to Issues List retrospectively.
- **Solve duplicates an existing To-Do or Rock:** Surface: *"This solve overlaps with existing {to-do/rock}. Merge or keep separate?"*
