# REI Offer Generator

> **Disclaimer:** This skill generates offer documents for informational and negotiation purposes only. These are not legally binding contracts. Always have a licensed real estate attorney review and finalize any purchase and sale agreement before signing. Laws governing real estate contracts vary by state.

## Overview

Bridges the gap between deal analysis and making an offer. Generates a professional Letter of Intent (LOI), initial offer letter, and creative finance term sheet — pre-populated with numbers from a saved deal analysis. The investor reviews, adjusts, and delivers. Includes a purchase price justification section the investor can share with the seller to support the offer.

## When This Skill Applies

- User says "make an offer", "draft an LOI", "write up an offer letter"
- User has run deal analysis and is ready to proceed
- User wants to structure creative finance terms on paper
- User needs a subject-to or seller finance term sheet
- User asks "how do I present this offer to the seller?"
- User says "draft my LOI for this deal"
- User needs a purchase price justification to share with a seller

## Pre-Flight — Load Data

1. **Load investor preferences:** Use `mcp__cloud-brain__search_notes` with query `REI preferences`. Load investor name, company, phone, email, and address (for offer letterhead).
2. **Load deal analysis:** Use `mcp__cloud-brain__search_notes` with the property address or slug. If found, pull: purchase price, financing type, terms, ARV, rent estimates, cap rate, CoC, cash flow. Note: "Found saved deal analysis from {date} — pre-loading those numbers."
3. **If no prior analysis found:** Ask the user for key deal inputs (purchase price, financing type, terms) before proceeding.
4. **Confirm offer details before drafting:** Present a summary and ask: "Before I draft the offer, confirm these details: Offer price: $X | Financing: [type] | Key terms: [summary]. Adjust anything?"

| Property address | Yes | 4521 Elm St, Dallas TX |
| Seller name | Helpful | John Smith |
| Offer price | Yes | $155,000 |

### Step 1: Draft Letter of Intent (LOI)

The LOI is non-binding and used to establish deal terms before a formal PSA is drafted. Keep it concise — 1 page.

```

### Step 2: Draft Purchase Price Justification

A one-page document the investor can share with the seller to support the offer price. Builds credibility and reduces friction.

```
PURCHASE PRICE JUSTIFICATION
Property: [Address]
Offered By: [Investor Name / Company]

WHY [PRICE] IS A FAIR OFFER

[3–4 bullet points explaining the basis for the offer price. Draw from saved deal analysis.]

Examples:
• Recent comparable sales in this area range from $[Low] to $[High].
  At $[Price], this offer is [consistent with / slightly below] the market
  given the property's [condition/needed repairs/age/features].

• Based on an independent analysis, the property in its current condition
  is estimated at $[as-is value]. The offer of $[price] accounts for
  [repairs/carrying costs/financing risk/time to close].

• If the property were listed on the MLS, it would likely need [list work]
  before it would attract retail buyers. I'm offering to take it as-is,
  which saves you [time / realtor commission / repair costs].

• I can close in [X] days with [no financing contingency / cash / minimal
  conditions], which has tangible value compared to a retail buyer requiring
  [30–60 days] and bank approval.

WHAT THIS OFFER SAVES YOU COMPARED TO A RETAIL SALE
[Present a simple comparison if helpful:]
| | Retail MLS Sale | This Offer |
|---|---|---|
| Estimated Sale Price | $[ARV] | $[Offer] |
| Realtor Commission (6%) | ($[Amount]) | $0 |
| Repairs Required | ($[Est. Repairs]) | $0 |
| Days to Close | 60–90 days | [X] days |
| Net to Seller | ~$[Net] | $[Offer] |

[Investor Name]
[Phone] | [Email]
```

### Step 3: Creative Finance Term Sheet (if applicable)

For seller finance or subject-to deals, provide a clean one-page term sheet the seller can review:

```
CREATIVE FINANCE TERM SHEET
Property: [Address]
Proposed By: [Investor Name / Company]
Date: [Date]

[SELLER FINANCE OPTION:]

Purchase Price:        $[Price]
Down Payment:          $[Down] (paid at closing)
Seller-Carried Note:   $[Note] at [X]% interest
Amortization:          [XX] years
Balloon Payment Due:   [Month/Year] (balance: ~$[Estimate])
Monthly Payment:       $[P&I]

What This Means for You:
• You receive $[Down] at closing
• You receive $[Payment]/month for [term] (like a steady income stream)
• At the balloon date, you receive the remaining ~$[Balance]
• Total received: $[Down] + $[Total Payments] = ~$[Grand Total]
• Plus interest income of ~$[Total Interest] over the term

[SUBJECT-TO OPTION:]

You keep the existing mortgage in place. I take over the payments immediately.

Existing Loan Balance:    $[Balance]
Your Existing Payment:    $[Payment]/mo (I handle this going forward)
Cash You Receive at Close: $[Price minus balance]
No bank involvement, no credit check — we close through a title company.

This term sheet is not a contract. All terms are subject to a mutually executed
Purchase and Sale Agreement reviewed by both parties and their attorneys.

[Investor Name] | [Phone] | [Email]
```

### Step 4: Save to Cloud Brain

```
Path: brain/offers/{address-slug}-offer-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md
Tool: mcp__cloud-brain__write_note
```

Tell the user: "Offer package saved. After the seller accepts, run `rei-due-diligence-tracker` to set up your contract-to-close deadline calendar."

## Output Delivered

1. **LOI** — ready to email or print
2. **Purchase Price Justification** — share with seller to support the offer
3. **Creative Finance Term Sheet** — if applicable
4. **Delivery note** — suggested subject line and brief cover message for sending the LOI

---

## Error Handling

- **No deal analysis in brain for this address:** Ask for key inputs manually (price, terms, financing type). Recommend running `rei-deal-analyzer` first for stronger justification.
- **No earnest money amount provided:** Default to $1,000 and note — investor should adjust based on market norms and seller relationship.
- **No closing timeline specified:** Default to "on or before [30 days from today]." Confirm with investor.
- **Subject-to but no existing loan details:** Ask for current balance, rate, monthly payment, and remaining term — required to build the term sheet.
- **Seller name unknown:** Use "Property Owner" in all documents; recommend finding the name via county records for a more personal delivery.
- **Investor asks to make the LOI binding:** Explain that a binding contract requires a properly executed Purchase and Sale Agreement reviewed by attorneys, not an LOI. Offer to note which terms should carry forward into the PSA.
